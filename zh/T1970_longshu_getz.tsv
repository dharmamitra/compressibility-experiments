修淨土者。宜隨其所以為善。以資修進之功。	Those who cultivate Pure Land should perform good deeds according to their livelihood in order to enhance the merit gained from their cultivation.
故此卷名特為勸諭。	Therefore, the subsections of this chapter are entreaties specifically for this purpose.
若不識字。全賴慈仁君子發菩薩心。為彼解說。	Those who are not literate should rely entirely upon compassionate gentlemen who, giving rise to the bodhisattva mind, explain these passages to them.
此布施之大者。先後之序乃自近及遠。或自急及緩。	Those carrying out this act of giving in a significant way should order their approach by starting with the near and moving to the distant, or from the urgent to the less pressing.
不拘其人高卑。	They should not be constrained by the loftiness or lowliness of a person’s social standing.
勸士人	Entreating Literati
士人或有未深讀書遂登高科者。有深讀書終身尚不預薦者。	Among literati, there are those who have not studied deeply and yet have directly achieved a degree in the civil service examinations, while there are others who have deeply studied for a whole lifetime but have not been recommended to take the exam.
豈非前世所種不同故其報不同乎。	Is this not a case of a difference in karmic seeds planted in previous lives resulting in divergent karmic outcomes?
雖然使少年登科涉華。要功業濟一時福報。亦有時而盡。	Though the youthful attainment of success on exams requires merit to contribute to this momentary reward, this merit over time will be exhausted.
奉勸後生者。勤於學問篤於孝友。遠念	I respectfully entreat members of the younger generation, while being diligent in learning and conscientious in filial piety and fraternal love, to distantly reflect:
吾曾高以來。誰其存者。亦留心此道。	“Who of my great and great-great grandparents is still alive? I will also heed this Way (Pure Land).
日月長而積累之功多。久則自有可樂。	After a long stretch of days and months, the accumulated merit from this practice will be significant, and at length I will achieve bliss.”
及年高者。當念已往之事皆如夢幻。	With regard to those advanced in years, you should reflect: “All the events of my past are like a dream.
日復一日。其誰免者。	Who is there that can avoid the passage of one day to another?
豈可不急留心此道也。	How is it then acceptable for me not to urgently heed this Way (Pure Land)?”
不問老少。若能轉以化人使更相勸化。現世獲福。身後必上品生。	If, irrespective of age, you are able to turn to the conversion of others, bringing them to mutually entreat and transform each other, you will obtain good fortune in this life and rebirth at the highest grade in the next.
勸有官君子	Entreating Gentlemen in Official Positions
有官君子無非前世修種作福故受此報。	Gentlemen in official positions have all cultivated and planted good karma in previous lives, and therefore have received the reward of their current positions.
譬如春時下種秋乃收獲。	This can be likened to planting in the spring, which brings harvest in the fall.
若不修福。何緣得此。然此報有盡。	If they had not cultivated good deeds, through what karmic condition could they then achieve this outcome? Yet this karmic reward itself will come to an end.
若更修福。行種種方便愛人利物之事。以此迴向西方。則直出輪迴之外。壽樂無窮。	If in cultivating good and carrying out every kind of saving deed through loving people and benefiting beings, these gentlemen further apply the merit from these actions to the Western Region, then they will directly escape saṃsāra, and their longevity and happiness will be without limit.
豈世間福報所能比哉。	How can worldly rewards compare with this?
若切意斯民。而不忍捨去。且生西方。了生死之後。却來此世界。現宰官身。以大興功利。何有不可哉。	If officials care deeply for the people and cannot bear to abandon them, what would prohibit them, after first being born in Pure Land and transcending the cycle of saṃsāra, from returning to this world and appearing in the form of a minister of state in order to accomplish a great benefit?
若能轉以此化人。使更相觀化人。則以己言重。必樂從之。	If officials are able to turn to the conversion of others, bring them to mutually entreat and convert each other, then, attaching great weight to their words, people will delight in following them.
據大慈菩薩偈。生世可以消災獲福。身後必上品生。	As indicated by the Daci Pusa jie (Gātha of the Bodhisattva of Great Compassion), they can avoid catastrophe and obtain prosperity in this world, and in the next life they will with certainty be reborn on the highest grade.”
勸在公門者	Entreating Clerks
在公門者當自念。云。	Clerks should reflect on themselves, saying,
彼為有官。我乃事彼。	“He (my supervisor) has an official post, while I am serving him.
彼尊我卑。	He is esteemed, while I am lowly.
彼逸我勞。	He is at rest, while I toil.
奉事常喜得以無虞。或有觸忤。加之譴責。	In carrying out affairs, he is frequently delighted and without worry, while I encounter adversity and am reprimanded.
是我前世所修不及於彼故至於此。	I have come to this because my cultivation in previous lives did not match his.
我但小心謹行。以保此身。	I alone must be careful and diligent in order to protect this current life.
事無大小。隨宜方便。	Deeds, no matter great or small, I will carry out properly as means to liberation.
目前人見歡悅。必無後患。	In the present, people will view my behavior with delight, and there will be no harm to me later.
積善不已。福及子孫。	I will accumulate good karma without cease, and good fortune will reach to my sons and grandsons.”
當思。在公門者。其子孫榮顯必祖上積德。天道昭明。不可不信。	You should think, “For clerks, there is no doubt that the achievement of honor by sons and grandsons requires the ancestors (as clerks) to accumulate virtue and to make illustrious the Way of Heaven.”
更常念阿彌陀佛。願生極樂世界。	You should further constantly recite “Amituo Fo” and vow to be reborn in the World of Extreme Bliss (Pure Land).
又轉以此化人。使更相勸化。	Furthermore you should turn to the conversion of others, bringing them to mutually entreat and convert each other.
非徒現世獲福。身後可中上品生。	Not only will you obtain good fortune in this world, but in the next life you can achieve the highest level of the middle grade of rebirth in pure land.
勸醫者	Entreating Physicians
醫者當自念。云。人身疾苦與我無異。	Physicians should reflect on themselves, saying, “Human illness and suffering are not separate from me.
凡來請召。急去無遲。	Whoever comes summoning me, I will urgently go without delay.
或止求藥。宜即發付。	Or if they simply seek medication, I ought to immediately dispense it.
勿問貴賤。勿擇貧富。	I will not ask if those seeking my help are of high estate or low, nor will I make choices based on their poverty or wealth.
專以救人為心。以結人緣。以積己福。冥冥中自有祐之者。	If I single-mindedly take saving people as my motivation, seeking to connect them to the Dharma and to accumulate merit for myself, then in the invisible realm I will have beings protecting me.
若乘人之急。切意求財。用心不仁。冥冥中自有禍之者。	If, on the other hand, taking advantage of the dire circumstances of others, I avidly seek wealth and my motivation is not humane, then in the invisible realm there will be beings who will harm me.”
吾鄉有張彥明善醫。	Our township has a benevolent physician Zhang Yanming.
僧道貧士軍兵官員及凡貧者求醫。皆不受錢。或反以錢米與之。	When monks and adepts, poor literati, soldiers, officials, and ordinary poor people seek his treatment, he accepts money from none, yet sometimes conversely hands out money and rice.
人若來召。雖至貧下亦去。	If people come summoning his help, even though they are extremely impoverished and lowly, he still goes to their aid.
富者以錢求藥。不問錢多寡。必多與藥。期於必愈。	When the wealthy solicit medicine with money, he does not inquire how much they have, but out of necessity provides considerable medication in hope of guaranteeing a cure.
未甞萠再携錢來求藥之心。	He has never harbored a wish that they would come again bearing cash in search of medicine.
病若危篤。知不可救。亦多與好藥。以慰其心。終不肯受錢。	When an illness is serious and he knows he cannot save the patient, he still administers a considerable amount of good medicine to put their mind at ease, and when they die, he is unwilling to collect money.
予與處甚久。詳知其人為醫而口終不言錢。	I have associated with him for a long time and know well that in his practice of medicine he never speaks of money.
可謂醫人中第一等人矣。	He can be acclaimed as a first-class individual among physicians.
一日城中火災周迴爇盡。	One day a conflagration in the middle of the city consumed the surroundings.
煙焰中獨存其居。	In the smoke and ashes only his residence survived.
一歲牛災尤甚。而其莊上獨全。	In a pestilence that killed year-old calves, only those in his neighborhood survived intact.
此神明祐助之明効也。	These are clearly efficacious signs that the gods are protecting and aiding him.
其子讀書。後乃預魁薦。	His son studied and later attained first on the civil service exam.
孫有二三。厖厚俊爽。	He has two or three grandsons who are imposing and stately in appearance.
亦天道福善之信然也。	This further makes credible the claim that the Way of Heaven rewards the good.
使其孜孜以錢物為心。失此數者。所得不足以償所失矣。	If he had been intent upon wealth and property, then considering that he would have lost these many blessings, what he would have gained could not have adequately compensated for what was lost.
同門之人可不鑒哉。若常如是存心迴向淨土。必上品生。	Should his fellow practitioners not mirror his example? If you as a physician continually apply merit from such a mindset to Pure Land, then you will certainly be reborn at the highest level.
若因人疾苦而告以淨土。則易生信心。	If people are suffering from illness and you tell them about the pure land, then this can readily generate belief.
使復發大願以廣其傳。以贖宿譴以期痊愈。必遂所願。	If these people further make an expansive vow to broaden the spread of Pure Land teaching, then [later] either in seeking redemption for past offenses or a cure for their illness, they will most certainly achieve the aim of their vows.
若天年或盡。亦可乘此願力徑生淨土。	If their years allotted by Heaven are at an end, they can, through the power of this vow, be born in Pure Land.
常如是以化人。非徒身後上品化生。現世則人必尊敬。而福報亦無窮。流及子孫矣。	If you persist in converting others in this way, you will not only achieve a rebirth in the next life at the highest level, but in the present life others will indeed hold you in esteem and your karmic reward will be without limit, extending to your children and grandchildren.
勸僧	Entreating Monks
僧家當自念。云。我為出家人。	Monks should reflect on themselves, saying, “I am a person who has gone forth from home.
了達生死。乃本分事不能如此。	Putting an end to the cycle of birth and death is a matter of apprehending my original state of enlightenment (benfenshi).
遂汩沒俗塵。	Not being able to do this, I have long been immersed in this world’s dust.
一日大限到來。有何倚賴。	One day when the great limit (death) arrives, what will I have to rely upon?
平日雖有善業。不免逐輪迴去。	Although I have acquired good karma in this lifetime, I will not avoid continuing saṃsāra.
善業報盡。又復墜墮	When my good karmic recompense is exhausted, I will again fall back into the cycle of saṃsāra.
不如早修淨土。	It would be better that I practice Pure Land.
直脫輪迴。面見阿彌陀佛。方是出家事畢。	Only when I have directly escaped saṃsāra and have met the Buddha Amitābha will my vocation of going forth from home be completed.”
如永明壽禪師長蘆賾禪師萬年一禪師。皆修此道。又轉以化人。使更相勸化。	The Chan Masters Yongming Yanshou, Changlu Zongze, Wannian Fayi all practiced this Path (of Pure Land). Moreover they turned to converting others, bringing them to mutually entreat and transform each other.
豈可効彼哉。	How then to emulate these masters?
凡受人一錢之施一食之供。皆當為說淨土以報其德。	Whenever you receive the donation of a single cash or the offering of a meal, in all instances you should speak to the donors about Pure Land in order to repay their virtue.
縱彼不信。亦使知之。	Even if they do not believe, you have still made them aware of it.
耳根漸熟。久而自信。	As their auditory sense base (ergen) gradually matures, in time they will eventually come to belief.
若或便信。其利益大矣。	Even if it is a provisional belief, its benefit will be immense.
常如此化人。現世則為人所敬。	If you frequently in this way convert people, you will be admired in this life.
己之善緣愈見純熟。又能精心觀想。不久必見佛之真身。	As your good karmic conditions become ever more manifest, you will further be able to single-mindedly visualize and in short order to see the true body of the Buddha.
此報身盡後必上品上生。為不退轉地菩薩矣。	After this karmic body ends, you will certainly be reborn in the highest level and become a nonretrogressing bodhisattva.
古語云。此身不向今生度。更向何生度此身。	An ancient saying states, “If you do not apply this [present] body to work for liberation in this very lifetime, then in what lifetime will you liberate this body?”
當常念此意。不可懈怠。	You must long reflect on the import of this, and you must not slack.
勸參禪者	Entreating Chan Practitioners
參禪大悟。遂脫生死輪迴。固為上矣。	To achieve the great enlightenment through the practice of Chan, and thus directly escape the cycle of life and death, is indeed the superior way.
然至此者百無二三。	But those arriving at this outcome number only two or three out of a hundred.
若修西方。	Yet out of a thousand not a single one will be lost of those cultivating Pure Land.
則直出輪迴。而生死自如萬不漏一。	They will directly transcend the cycle of saṃsāra and make life and death one.
故予欲勸僧家。上根器者參禪之外。每日以頃刻之暇修西方。	I therefore desire to entreat monks, other than those with superior roots who are able to practice Chan, to cultivate Pure Land for brief periods each day.
若參禪大悟。遂超脫輪迴。尚去佛地極遠。更往見阿彌陀佛。展禮致敬。有何不可。	If you then achieve enlightenment through the practice of Chan, there will be nothing to keep you from transcending saṃsāra, traveling extreme distances to buddhalands and further going to see the Buddha Amitābha where you will do obeisance and honor him.
若未得大悟。而壽數忽盡。且徑往西方。見佛聞法。	If [on the other hand] you have not yet attained the great enlightenment, and the number of your years suddenly comes to an end, you will temporarily pass through Pure Land where you will see the Buddha and hear the Dharma.
何患其不大悟也。	What harm would there be then in not having achieved the great enlightenment?
若不修西方。不免隨業緣去。	If, however, you don’t practice Pure Land, you will not avoid going on in saṃsāra.
雖如青草堂戒禪師真如喆。皆汩沒輪迴。	Even figures like Qingcaotang, Chan Master Jie, and Zhenru Zhe all sank back into saṃsāra.
誠可畏者。	This is truly frightful!
詳見第七卷。	For a detailed account of their outcomes see Fascicle Seven of this work.
若不忽此道。精心修進。仍轉以化人。使更相勸化人。則以己為名僧。必樂從其言。	If a Chan master does not ignore this Way but makes progress in single-mindedly cultivating it and further turns to converting others, making them in turn entreat and convert each other, then others, regarding him as a renowned monk, will happily follow his words.
其為利益無窮。己必上品上生。	He will bring benefit without end and he will most certainly be reborn in the highest level of the highest grade.
勸富者	Entreating Wealthy Persons
富者當自念。云。	A wealthy person should reflect on himself, saying,
我今生富足。皆由前世修種。譬如今年所食之穀乃去年所種也。	“I am prosperous in this life all because in previous lives I cultivated seeds, just as the grain that is eaten this year is that which was planted last year.
然人生衣食財祿陰司皆有定數。	Raiment and food, wealth and status, and afterworld judgment all have a fixed amount.
徐徐營生合有之數亦自然來。	The combined amount from continuous past living also arrives naturally.
其來之遲乃可延壽。如水淺流則久也。	The delay of its arrival can lengthen life, just like when water is shallow, its flow will be long.
若急急貪求亦只此數。	If I am frantically avaricious in seeking things, there is still just this amount.
數外得之則禍生而去。如水過滿則溢也。	Thus, if I acquire something outside the [allotted] amount, then calamities will occur and I will depart this life, just as when water passes full, it spills over.
宜隨分為生。不使滿溢。	I should live my life according to its allotment, not causing it to spill over.
少損濟物以防滿溢。	I should reduce my use of things to avert a spillover.
非徒可以享現世之安。又可種後來之福。	[In this way] not only can I enjoy tranquility in this world, I can also plant future prosperity.”
仍當念。世間福亦有盡。	You should further reflect, “The prosperity of this world also has its end.
若以迴向西方則無盡。	If I apply merit to the Western Realm, then there will be no end to it.
況世間富足亦不能色色如意。	What is more, the wealth and prosperity of this world cannot bring about contentment in every respect.
唯留意西方。則自有可樂。	Only by keeping my thoughts on the Western Realm will I acquire happiness.”
更相印施西方文字。以廣勸人。使更相勸化	You as a merchant should further sponsor the printing and donation of Pure Land writings in order to widely encourage people, making them in turn entreat and convert each other.
此為種無窮之福。	This is the planting of inexhaustible merit.
現世可以消災禳難。鬼神亦敬而祐之。	In this world you can avert disaster and exorcise calamity; spirits and gods will honor and protect you.
身後必上品上生。	And after this life, you will certainly be reborn in the highest level of the highest grade.
勸貪吝者	Entreating Greedy and the Miserly Persons
得人三千而不以為多者貪也。	To acquire three thousand in cash from others but to regard it as paltry is greed.
自費兩千而遂以為多者吝也。	To spend two thousand but then to regard that amount as excessive is miserliness.
貪吝之失眾人所同而不自覺。	The shortcomings of greed and miserliness are shared with all people and yet you are unaware of these shortcomings in yourself.
若能去此。方為賢者。	If you can eliminate these, then you can become a worthy.
如是則善業無不可為。惡業無不可戒。	In this way good deeds can all be accomplished while evil deeds can all be stopped.
何則不吝財以為善。不貪財以為惡故也。	Why is this so? Because not being miserly with wealth is the doing of good, while being greedy involves the doing of evil.
若如是以修淨土。必不在下品生矣。	If through such conduct you cultivate Pure Land, then you most certainly will not be reborn on the lowest level.
又能轉以化人。使更相勸化人。則以己無貪吝之心。必加尊敬而樂從其化。	If you can further turn to converting others, making them in turn entreat and convert each other, then, because your heart is devoid of greed and miserliness, they will revere you even more and will gladly follow your attempts to transform them.
所化必廣。	The extent of those converted will be vast.
上品往生復何疑哉。	What doubt will there be about being reborn at the highest level?
生前之福報亦可立而見矣。	A good karmic outcome in the present life will also be established and manifest.
此不可以言盡。	This outcome will be beyond description.
行者當自知之。	Those cultivating themselves should be selfaware with regard to this.
勸孝子	Entreating Filial Sons
長蘆賾禪師作孝友文百二十篇。	Chan Master Changlu Zongze wrote the Xiaoyou wen (Treatise on filial piety and brotherly love) in 120 pieces.
前百篇言奉養甘旨為世間之孝。	The first hundred pieces, discussing happily serving and caring for one’s parents, are concerned with this-worldly filial piety.
後二十篇言勸父母修淨土為出世間之孝。	The last twenty pieces, articulating entreating one’s parents to practice Pure Land, are concerned with otherworldly filial piety.
蓋世間之孝一世而止。猶為孝之小者。	Thus the filial piety of this world is for one lifetime and is yet a lesser type of filial piety.
出世間之孝無時而盡。	The filial piety of the other world is never exhausted.
以父母生淨土。福壽不止如恒河沙劫。此莫大孝也。	Helping your parents be born in Pure Land where happiness and longevity are without limit, lasting for kalpas as many as the sands of the Ganges, is the greatest type of filial piety.
父母存而不能以此勸勉。他日徒傷其心徒為厚禮。亦何益乎。	What advantage is there if, when your parents are alive, you are unable to encourage them in the practice of Pure Land, only at a later time to grieve them and carry out rites to them in vain?
若又能轉以化人。使更相勸化。以此功德。資父母之福壽。厚父母之善報。	If further you are able to turn to converting others, and bring others in turn to entreat and convert each other, then the merit from this activity will enhance the good fortune and longevity of your parents and increase their karmic recompense.
佛不阻眾生之願。	The Buddha does not obstruct the vows of sentient beings.
此意必可遂矣。	This filial intention of yours will for certain be accomplished.
上品上生者先言孝養父母。	For those born in the highest rank of the highest grade, we must speak first of their being filial and caring for their parents.
吾能推是心以為孝養。其往生品第可見矣。	The reason I am able to promote this intention as being filial and caring is evident in the level of birth attained.
勸骨肉恩愛者	Entreating Those Who Love Their Flesh and Blood
骨肉恩愛者當自念。云。大慈菩薩有偈云。骨肉恩情相愛。難期白首團圓。	Those who love their flesh and blood should reflect on themselves, saying, “The Bodhisattva of Great Compassion has a gātha that states, Mutual love and devotion for flesh and blood Have little hope that all will gather in old age.
幾多強壯亡身。	How many are those who perish in their prime?
更有嬰孩命盡。	Further are the infants and children whose lives are gone.
勸念阿彌陀佛。	Entreat them to recite “Amituo Fo.”
七寶池中化生。聚會永無別離。萬劫長生快樂。	Then, being reborn on the seven-jeweled pond, there will be a gathering that will never part in a long life of happiness lasting ten thousand ages.”
不能如是。徒為好衣以華其身。美食以悅其口。一旦分離無著力處。	If you are unable to do this and only provide clothing to adorn their bodies and exquisite food to delight their palate, one day you will be separated from them, powerless to do anything about it.
故生前宜相勸以念佛。	Thus in this lifetime you should mutually entreat each other to recite the Buddha’s name.
若又能轉以化人。使更相勸化。是不徒使己之骨肉有無窮之恩愛。亦使他人骨肉有無窮之恩愛。	If you are further able to turn to converting others, making them in turn to entreat and convert each other, this will not only bring about a love without end for your loved ones, it will further bring about a love without end for the loved ones of others.
其福報豈有窮盡。	How could it be that their karmic recompense would be used up?
必中上品生。	You will certainly be reborn in the highest rank of the middle grade of Pure Land.
勸婦人	Entreating [Married] Women
婦人當自念。云。據佛所言。慾心重者受婦女身。	Married women should reflect on themselves, saying, “According to the word of the Buddha, those with strong passions will be given a woman’s body.
是已非善業。	This already is unwholesome karma.
若不自省。更加嫉妬貪慾。業緣轉深。果報可畏。	If I don’t not reflect on myself, but add jealousy and greed to my current plight, my karmic bonds will deepen and the outcome will be frightful.
若能迴心懺悔絕其非念。仁慈以待婢妾。溫和以禮上下。常念阿彌陀佛。發願云。	If I change my heart, repent, and put an end to negative thoughts; if I am humane and compassionate in dealing with maidservants and concubines, and gentle in decorum to those above and below me; if I frequently recite ‘Amituo Fo’ and make a vow:
願我黑業日消。白業日長現身清淨。內外輕安。此世之後永不復受女身。	‘May my dark karma dissipate each day, and may my white karma grow by the day;’ if I am pure in my present life, and am inwardly and outwardly serene, then after this lifetime, I will never again receive the body of a woman.”
使念念不斷。	Perform recitation after recitation without cease.
念自純熟。定生極樂世界。	When your recitations naturally come to maturation, you will for certain be reborn in the World of Ultimate Bliss.
若轉以化一家及婢妾及宗族親戚。其福報無窮。	If you turn to converting your household, including maidservants, concubines, and clan relatives, your good karmic recompense will be inexhaustible.
必上品生。	And you will certainly be reborn in the highest level.
觀荊王夫人傳可見矣。在第五卷。	See Madame Jing Wang’s biography in Fascicle Five where these outcomes are manifest.
勸僕妾	Entreating Servants
為僕妾者當自念。云。	Those who are servants should reflect on themselves, saying,
我前世不曾修福故至貧賤。	“In previous lives I have not cultivated good karma and thus I have ended up poor and lowly.
人受安逸。我當勤勞。	Others live in leisure, while I must toil.
人享美味。我食麁糲。	Others enjoy fine flavors, while I consume coarse grains.
人服輕細。我著麁惡。	Others don garments both light and finely woven, while I wear clothes that are rough and inferior.”
此皆前世業緣。	This is all due to karmic conditions generated in past lives.
已往者不可悔。自此之後。當念善改過。	That which is past cannot be undone; from this point on, you should be mindful of goodness and amend your faults.
忠直勤謹。小心奉事。以保此身以種後福。	You must be loyal and forthright, conscientious and diligent, carrying out your service with care, all of this in order to protect your current life and plant merit for your future.
常念阿彌陀佛。念念不絕。	You should constantly recite “Amituo Fo,” performing recitation upon recitation without cease.
念自純熟。定生極樂世界。	When your recitations come to fruition, then you will with certainty be reborn in the Realm of Highest Bliss.
又以化其同類。使更相勸化。則福報無窮。必中上品生。	Furthermore, if you convert fellow servants, making them mutually entreat other to change, then the good karmic outcomes that come from this will be without end, and you will with certainty be reborn in the highest rank in the middle grade of Pure Land.
勸農者	Entreating Farmers
為農者當自念。云。	Farmers should reflect on themselves, saying,
農業雖為務本。然耕田種地。殺害微細物命。亦不為少。	“Despite the fact that farming is the foundation of all occupations, I have nevertheless killed and harmed the lives of numerous minute beings through plowing and planting.”
此雖無可奈何。若能委由全護懺悔前失。常念阿彌陀佛。發大願云。	Although this could not be helped, you should attempt to protect all beings to the degree that you are able, repent past misdeeds, constantly recite “Amituo Fo,” and make a great vow, announcing,
願我見佛得道之後。先度耕種以來一切所殺微細眾生。	“After I have seen the Buddha and attained the Way, may I first save all the minute sentient beings whose lives I have taken since engaging in plowing and planting.
次度一切冤親眾生。	Next, may I save all the sentient beings, both hated and loved.”
常作此念。使念念不絕。	Frequently producing this thought, perform recitation upon recitation without cease.
念自純熟。定生極樂世界。	When your recitations naturally come to maturation, you will with certainty be reborn in the Realm of Highest Bliss.
若轉以化人。使更相勸化。現世獲福。身後必中上品生。	If you turn to converting others, making them entreat and convert each other, you will obtain karmic recompense in this life, and in the next you will be born in the highest level of the middle grade of pure land.
勸養蠶者	Entreating Cultivators of Silk Worms
養蠶者當自念。云。	Those raising silk worms should reflect on themselves, saying,
蠶為絲以為人衣。	“Worms produce silken threads that are made into human clothing.
此固世間常理。	This has been an enduring custom through the ages.
然亦是殺害物命。	And yet it too involves the killing of living beings.”
世人以為。馬鳴菩薩考於藏經。	People of this age think that Bodhisattva Aśvaghoṣa found a justification for sericulture in the scriptures.
本無此說。	But the scriptures originally had no such teaching.
唯說佛訓弟子。不得衣綿絹及用皮為鞋履。為殺物命而得。	There was only the teaching of the Buddha instructing his disciples not to clothe themselves with silk or to use leather for shoes, that is, things obtained through the taking of life.
人既以養蠶為業。	People have long engaged in raising silk worms for a living.
豈可不知慚愧。	How could they not be aware of its shamefulness?”
當常懺悔念阿彌陀佛發大願云。	You should frequently repent, recite “Amituo Fo,” and make a great vow, saying,
願我見佛得道之後。盡度養蠶以來所殺一切蠶命。	“After I have seen the Buddha and attained the Way, may I save all those silk worms that whose lives I have taken since engaging in sericulture.”
使念念不絕。	Perform recitation upon recitation without cease.
念自純熟。亦生極樂世界。	When your recitations naturally come to maturation, you will for certain be reborn in the World of Ultimate Bliss.
若轉以化人。使相勸化。現世必獲福報。身後亦中品生。	If you turn to converting others, making them in turn entreat and convert each other, then in this world you will obtain happy recompense and after this life you will be reborn in the highest level of the middle grade of pure land.
勸商賈	Entreating Merchants
為商賈者當自念。云。	Those who are merchants should reflect on themselves, saying,
平生販賣寧無欺偽。若是疋帛。皆由蠶命而得。不可謂全無過惡。	“If my life of selling things, albeit without deceit, involved bolts of silk obtained through the lives of silk worms, then I can not be said to be without blame.
一旦命盡。隨業緣去。	One day my life will be over, and I will depart following my karmic bonds.
不如懺悔為善。隨分營生。	It would be better that I repent and carry out good deeds, making a living according to my allotted portion.
命若多財自然漸有。命若少財多得亦失。	If my fate is great wealth, then I will naturally and gradually acquire it; if my fate is to have little wealth, then the acquisition of more would further lead to loss.
況人生財數有限。	What is more, the allotment of wealth during a lifetime has a limit.
急求而數滿則致早終。	If I hurriedly seek wealth and my allotment is filled, then I will come to a premature end.
緩求而來遲則可延壽。宜以此存心。	If I seek it gradually and it arrives late then my life will be lengthened.” You must take care with this.
當念阿彌陀佛。願見佛得道之後。先度一切與己交涉眾生。	You should recite “Amituo Fo” and make a vow: “When I have seen the Buddha and attained the Way, may I first save all those with whom I have had dealings.
次度一切冤親。	Next, may I save both enemies and loved ones.
次度一切有緣無緣眾生。	And then, may I save all with whom I have had karmic links and those with whom I have had none.”
如此念念不絕。	In this way, perform recitation upon recitation without cease.
念自純熟。定生極樂世界。	When your recitations naturally come to maturation, you will for certain be reborn in the World of Ultimate Bliss.
若轉以化人。使更相勸化。現世獲福。身後必中上品生。	If you turn to converting others, making them in turn entreat and convert each other, then in this world you will obtain happy recompense, and after this life you will certainly be born in the highest level of the middle grade of pure land.
勸工匠	Entreating Craftsmen
為工匠者當自念。云。	Craftsmen should reflect upon themselves, saying,
我為工匠。或為人造屋宇。或為人作器用。	“Working as a craftsman, I have sometimes built houses for people and sometimes made furnishings for people’s use.
此雖為善業。然以前世不曾修種故。今生自不富足。	Though this is a wholesome occupation, yet because I did not cultivate seeds in previous lives, in this life, I am impoverished.
所造之屋乃他人居。	The dwellings that I have built, other people occupy.
所作之器乃他人用。	The furnishings I have crafted, others use.
若不如是。衣食虧闕。	If things were otherwise (and I had not engaged in this occupation), then I would be in want of clothing and food.
當隨分為善。	I should follow my lot and do good deeds.
為人造作之時。物不過望事。則盡心。	When I am making things for other people, those things are nothing but the work that I am addressing at the moment, so I will apply my self assiduously.”
此亦種福。	This also is a way of planting merit.
常念阿彌陀佛。用斧斤時。亦一心常念。使念念不絕。	You should constantly recite “Amituo Fo.” When you are wielding an axe, you should also single-mindedly, constantly recite [the name], performing recitation upon recitation without cease.
念自純熟。定生極樂世界。	When your recitations naturally come to maturation, you will for certain be reborn in the World of Ultimate Bliss.
若轉以化人。使更相勸化。現世獲福。身後必中上品生。	If you turn to converting others, making them in turn entreat and convert each other, then in this world you will obtain happy recompense, and after this life be reborn in highest level of the middle grade of pure land.
