善法經	The Discourse on Wholesome Qualities
我聞如是：一時，佛遊舍衛國，在勝林給孤獨園。	Thus have I heard: At one time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.
爾時，世尊告諸比丘：「若有比丘成就七法者，便於賢聖得歡喜樂，正趣漏盡。	At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: If a monk achieves seven qualities, then he will attain joy and happiness in [the path of] the noble ones and will progress rightly toward the cessation of the taints.
云何為七？	What are the seven?
謂比丘知法、知義、知時、知節、知己、知眾、知人勝如。	They are: a monk knows the Dharma, knows the meaning, knows the proper time, knows restraint, knows himself, knows assemblies, and knows persons according to their superiority.
云何比丘為知法耶？	How does a monk know the Dharma?
謂比丘知正經、歌詠、記說、偈咃、因緣、撰錄、本起、此說、生處、廣解、未曾有法及說是義，是謂比丘為知法也。	A monk knows the discourses, stanzas, expositions, verses, causes, inspired utterances, heroic tales, [what has been] thus said, birth stories, answers to questions, marvels, and explanations of meaning. This is a monk who knows the Dharma. 
若有比丘不知法者，謂不知正經、歌詠、記說、偈咃、因緣、撰錄、本起、此說、生處、廣解、未曾有法及說義，如是比丘為不知法。	If a monk does not know the Dharma—that is to say, does not know the discourses, stanzas, expositions, verses, causes, inspired utterances, heroic tales, [what has been] thus said, birth stories, answers to questions, marvels, and explanations of meaning—then such a monk is one who does not know the Dharma.
若有比丘善知法者，謂知正經、歌詠、記說、偈咃、因緣、撰錄、本起、此說、生處、廣解、未曾有法及說義，是謂比丘善知法也。	If, [however,] a monk knows the Dharma well—that is to say, knows the discourses, stanzas, expositions, verses, causes, inspired utterances, heroic tales, [what has been] thus said, birth stories, answers to questions, marvels, and explanations of meaning—then such a monk is one who knows the Dharma well.
云何比丘為知義耶？	How does a monk know the meaning?
謂比丘知彼彼說義是彼義、是此義，是謂比丘為知義也。	A monk knows the meaning of various explanations: The meaning is this, the meaning is that. This is a monk who knows the meaning.
若有比丘不知義者，謂不知彼彼說義是彼義、是此義，如是比丘為不知義。	If a monk does not know the meaning—that is to say, does not know the meaning of various explanations: The meaning is this, the meaning is that—then such a monk is one who does not know the meaning.
若有比丘善知義者，謂知彼彼說義是彼義、是此義，是謂比丘善知義也。	If, [however,] a monk knows the meaning well—that is to say, knows the meaning of various explanations: The meaning is this, the meaning is that—then such a monk is one who knows the meaning well.
云何比丘為知時耶？	How does a monk know the proper time?
謂比丘知是時修下相，是時修高相，是時修捨相，是謂比丘為知時也。	A monk knows: This is the time to develop the characteristic of settling, This is the time to develop the characteristic of arousing, This is the time to develop the characteristic of equanimity. This is a monk who knows the proper time.
若有比丘不知時者，謂不知是時修下相，是時修高相，是時修捨相，如是比丘為不知時。	If a monk does not know the proper time—that is to say, he does not know: This is the time to develop the characteristic of settling, This is the time to develop the characteristic of arousing, This is the time to develop the characteristic of equanimity—then such a monk is one who does not know the proper time.
若有比丘善知時者，謂知是時修下相，是時修高相，是時修捨相，是謂比丘善知時也。	If, [however,] a monk knows well the proper time—that is to say, he knows: This is the time to develop the characteristic of settling, This is the time to develop the characteristic of arousing, This is the time to develop the characteristic of equanimity—then such a monk knows well the proper time.
云何比丘為知節耶？	How does a monk know restraint?
謂比丘知節，若飲若食、若去若住、若坐若臥、若語若默、若大小便，捐除睡眠，修行正智，是謂比丘為知節也。	A monk knows restraint who, having discarded sloth and torpor, practices right attentiveness when drinking, eating, going, standing, sitting, lying down, speaking, keeping silent, defecating, or urinating. This is a monk who knows restraint.
若有比丘不知節者，謂不知若飲若食、若去若住、若坐若臥、若語若默、若大小便，捐除睡眠，修行正智，如是比丘為不知節。	If a monk does not know restraint—that is to say, he does not know [how] to discard sloth and torpor and practice right attentiveness when drinking, eating, going, standing, sitting, lying down, speaking, keeping silent, defecating, or urinating—then such a monk is one who does not know restraint.
若有比丘善知節者，謂知若飲若食，若去若住，若坐若臥、若語若默、若大小便，捐除睡眠，修行正智，是謂比丘善知節也。	If, [however,] a monk knows restraint well—that is to say, he knows [how] to discard drowsiness and practice right attentiveness when drinking, eating, going, standing, sitting, lying down, speaking, keeping silent, defecating, or urinating—then such a monk is one who knows restraint well.
云何比丘為知己耶？	How does a monk know himself?
謂比丘自知我有爾所信、戒、聞、施、慧、辯、阿含及所得，是謂比丘為知己也。	A monk knows of himself: I have such faith, such virtue, such learning, such generosity, such wisdom, such eloquence, such [knowledge of] the canonical texts, and such attainments. This is a monk who knows himself.
若有比丘不知己者，謂不自知我有爾所信、戒、聞、施、慧、辯、阿含及所得，如是比丘為不知己。	If a monk does not know himself—that is to say, he does not know of himself: I have such faith, such virtue, such learning, such generosity, such wisdom, such eloquence, such [knowledge of] the canonical texts, and such attainments—then such a monk is one who does not know himself.
若有比丘善知己者，謂自知我有爾所信、戒、聞、施、慧、辯、阿含及所得，是謂比丘善知己也。	If, [however,] a monk knows himself well—that is to say, he knows of himself: I have such faith, such virtue, such learning, such generosity, such wisdom, such eloquence, such [knowledge of] the canonical texts, and such attainments—then such a monk is one who knows himself well.
云何比丘為知眾耶？	How does a monk know assemblies?
謂比丘知此剎利眾、此梵志眾、此居士眾、此沙門眾，我於彼眾應如是去、如是住、如是坐、如是語、如是默，是謂比丘為知眾也。	A monk knows: This is an assembly of khattiyas, This is an assembly of brahmins, This is an assembly of householders, This is an assembly of renunciants; In that [type of] assembly I ought to walk like this, stand like this, sit like this, speak like this, keep silent like this. This is a monk who knows assemblies.
若有比丘不知眾者，謂不知此剎利眾、此梵志眾、此居士眾、此沙門眾，我於彼眾應如是去、如是住、如是坐、如是語、如是默，如是比丘為不知眾。	If a monk does not know assemblies—that is to say, he does not know: This is an assembly of khattiyas, This is an assembly of brahmins, This is an assembly of householders, This is an assembly of renunciants; In that [type of] assembly I ought to walk like this, stand like this, sit like this, speak like this, keep silent like this— then such a monk is one who does not know assemblies.
若有比丘善知眾者，謂知此剎利眾、此梵志眾、此居士眾、此沙門眾、我於彼眾應如是去、如是住、如是坐、如是語、如是默，是謂比丘善知眾也。	If, [however,] a monk knows assemblies well—that is to say, he knows: This is an assembly of khattiyas, This is an assembly of brahmins, This is an assembly of householders, This is an assembly of renunciants; In that [type of] assembly I ought to walk like this, stand like this, sit like this, speak like this, keep silent like this—then such a monk is one who knows assemblies well.
云何比丘知人勝如？	How does a monk know persons according to their superiority?
謂比丘知有二種人，有信、有不信；若信者勝，不信者為不如也。	A monk knows that there are two types of persons: those who have faith and those who do not have faith. Those who have faith are superior; those who do not have faith are inferior.
謂信人復有二種，有數往見比丘、有不數往見比丘；若數往見比丘者勝，不數往見比丘者為不如也。	Of persons who have faith there are again two types: those who frequently go to see monks and those who do not frequently go to see monks. Those who frequently go to see monks are superior; those who do not frequently go to see monks are inferior.
謂數往見比丘人復有二種，有禮敬比丘、有不禮敬比丘；若禮敬比丘者勝，不禮敬比丘者為不如也。	Of persons who frequently go to see monks there are again two types: those who pay their respects to monks and those who do not pay their respects to monks. Those who pay their respects to monks are superior; those who do not pay their respects to monks are inferior.
謂禮敬比丘人復有二種，有問經、有不問經；若問經者勝，不問經者為不如也。	Of persons who pay their respects to monks there are again two types: those who ask about the discourses and those who do not ask about the discourses. Those who ask about the discourses are superior; those who do not ask about the discourses are inferior.
謂問經人復有二種，有一心聽經、有不一心聽經；	Of persons who ask about the discourses there are again two types: those who listen with concentration to a discourse and those who do not listen with concentration to a discourse.
若一心聽經者勝，不一心聽經者為不如也。	Those who listen with concentration to a discourse are superior; those who do not listen with concentration to a discourse are inferior.
謂一心聽經人復有二種，有聞持法、有聞不持法；	Of persons who listen with concentration to a discourse there are again two types: those who retain the Dharma they have heard and those who do not retain the Dharma they have heard.
若聞持法者勝，聞不持法者為不如也。	Those who retain the Dharma they have heard are superior; those who do not retain the Dharma they have heard are inferior.
謂聞持法人復有二種，有聞法觀義、有聞法不觀義；	Of persons who retain the Dharma they have heard there are again two types: those who examine the meaning of the Dharma they have heard and those who do not examine the meaning of the Dharma they have heard.
若聞法觀義者勝，聞法不觀義者為不如也。	Those who examine the meaning of the Dharma they have heard are superior; those who do not examine the meaning of the Dharma they have heard are inferior.
謂聞法觀義人復有二種，有知法、知義、向法次法、隨順於法、如法行之； 有不知法、不知義、不向法次法、不隨順法、不如法行。	Of persons who examine the meaning of the Dharma they have heard there are again two types: those who know the Dharma, know its meaning, progress in the Dharma, follow the Dharma, conform to the Dharma, and practice in accordance with the Dharma; and those who do not know the Dharma, do not know its meaning, do not progress in the Dharma, do not follow the Dharma, do not conform to the Dharma, and do not practice in accordance with the Dharma.
若知法、知義、向法次法、隨順於法、如法行者勝；	Those who know the Dharma, know its meaning, progress in the Dharma, follow the Dharma, conform to the Dharma, and practice in accordance with the Dharma are superior.
不知法、不知義、不向法次法、不隨順法、不如法行者為不如也。	Those who do not know the Dharma, do not know its meaning, do not progress in the Dharma, do not follow the Dharma, do not conform to the Dharma, and do not practice in accordance with the Dharma are inferior.
謂知法、知義、向法次法、隨順於法、如法行人復有二種，有自饒益，亦饒益他，饒益多人，愍傷世間，為天、為人求義及饒益，求安隱快樂； 有不自饒益，亦不饒益他，不饒益多人，不愍傷世間，不為天、不為人求義及饒益，求安隱快樂。	Of persons who know the Dharma, know its meaning, progress in the Dharma, follow the Dharma, conform to the Dharma, and practice in accordance with the Dharma, there are again two types: there are those who benefit themselves and benefit others, who benefit many people, who have compassion for the world, seek advantage and benefit for gods and human beings, and seek their peace and happiness; and there are those who do not benefit themselves and do not benefit others, who do not benefit many people, who do not have compassion for the world, do not seek advantage and benefit for gods and human beings, and do not seek their peace and happiness.
若自饒益，亦饒益他，饒益多人，愍傷世間，為天、為人求義及饒益，求安隱快樂者，此人於彼人中為極第一，為大、為上、為最、為勝、為尊、為妙。	Those who benefit themselves and benefit others, who benefit many people, who have compassion for the world, seek advantage and benefit for gods and human beings, and seek their peace and happiness—this [type of] person is supreme among the [types of] person [mentioned above], the greatest, the highest, the best, the superior one, the most excellent one, the most sublime.
譬如因牛有乳，因乳有酪，因酪有生酥，因生酥有熟酥，因熟酥有酥精，酥精者，於彼中為極第一，為大、為上、為最、為勝、為尊、為妙，如是若人自饒益，亦饒益他，饒益多人，愍傷世間，為天、為人求義及饒益，求安隱快樂。	It is just as from a cow comes milk, from milk comes cream, from cream comes butter, from butter comes ghee, and from ghee comes cream of ghee; and among these cream of ghee is supreme, the greatest, the highest, the best, the superior one, the most excellent one, the most sublime.
此二人如上所說，如上分別，如上施設，此為第一，為大，為上、為最、為勝、為尊、為妙，是謂比丘知人勝如。」	In the same way, if persons benefit themselves and benefit others, benefit many people, have compassion for the world, seek advantage and benefit for gods and human beings, and seek their peace and happiness, then of the two [types of] person spoken of above, distinguished above, and designated above, this one is supreme, the greatest, the highest, the best, the superior one, the most excellent, the most sublime. This is [how] a monk knows persons according to their superiority.
佛說如是。	This is what the Buddha said.
彼諸比丘聞佛所說，歡喜奉行。	Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.

晝度樹經	The Discourse on the Coral Tree
我聞如是：一時，佛遊舍衛國，在勝林給孤獨園。	Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.
爾時，世尊告諸比丘：「若三十三天晝度樹葉萎黃，是時，三十三天悅樂歡喜，晝度樹葉不久當落。	At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: When the leaves of the coral tree of the thirty-three gods become withered, the thirty-three gods are happy and rejoice, [saying]:
復次，三十三天晝度樹葉已落，是時，三十三天悅樂歡喜，晝度樹葉不久當還生。	The leaves of the coral tree will soon fall! Again, when the leaves of the coral tree of the thirty-three gods have fallen, the thirty-three gods are happy and rejoice:
復次，三十三天晝度樹葉已還生，是時，三十三天悅樂歡喜，晝度樹不久當生網。	The [new] leaves of the coral tree will soon appear! Again, when the [new] leaves of the coral tree of the thirty-three gods have appeared, the thirty-three gods are happy and rejoice:
復次，三十三天晝度樹已生網，是時，三十三天悅樂歡喜，晝度樹不久當生如鳥喙。	The coral tree will soon grow buds! Again, when the coral tree of the thirty-three gods has grown buds, the thirty-three gods are happy and rejoice:
復次，三十三天晝度樹已生如鳥喙，是時，三十三天悅樂歡喜，晝度樹不久當開如鉢。	The [buds of the] coral tree will soon resemble a bird’s beak! Again, when the [buds of the] coral tree of the thirty-three gods resemble a bird’s beak, the thirty-three gods are happy and rejoice:
復次，三十三天晝度樹已開如鉢，是時，三十三天悅樂歡喜，晝度樹不久當盡敷開。	The [buds of the] coral tree will soon open up and resemble bowls! Again, [when the buds of] the coral tree of the thirty-three gods have opened up and resemble bowls, the thirty-three gods are happy and rejoice:
若晝度樹已盡敷開，光所照、色所映、香所熏，周百由延，是時，三十三天於中夏四月，以天五欲功德具足而自娛樂，是謂三十三天於晝度樹下集會娛樂也。	The coral tree will soon be in full bloom! When the coral tree is in full bloom, the radiance it emits, the color it reflects, and the fragrance it emits spread a hundred leagues around. Then, for the four months of the summer season the thirty-three gods amuse themselves equipped with the five types of divine sense pleasure.
「如是義，聖弟子亦復爾，思念出家，是時聖弟子名為葉黃，猶三十三天晝度樹葉萎黃也。	This is [how] the thirty-three gods assemble and amuse themselves beneath their coral tree. It is just the same with the noble disciple. When thinking of leaving the household life, the noble disciple is reckoned as having withered leaves, like the withered leaves of the coral tree of the thirty-three gods.
復次，聖弟子剃除鬚髮，著袈裟衣，至信、捨家、無家、學道，是時聖弟子名為葉落，猶三十三天晝度樹葉落也。	Again, the noble disciple shaves off [his] hair and beard, dons the yellow robe, and, out of faith, leaves the household life, becomes homeless, and practices the path. At this time the noble disciple is reckoned as one whose leaves have fallen, like the falling of the leaves of the coral tree of the thirty-three gods.
復次，聖弟子離欲、離惡不善之法，有覺、有觀，離生喜樂，得初禪成就遊，是時，聖弟子名葉還生，猶三十三天晝度樹葉還生也。	Again, the noble disciple, separated from desires, separated from evil and unwholesome states, with initial and sustained application of the mind, with joy and happiness born of separation, dwells having attained the first absorption. At this time the noble disciple is reckoned as one whose new leaves have appeared, like the appearing of the new leaves on the coral tree of the thirty-three gods.
復次，聖弟子覺觀已息，內靜、一心，無覺無觀，定生喜樂，得第二禪成就遊，是時，聖弟子名為生網，猶三十三天晝度樹生網也。	Again, the noble disciple, through the calming of initial and sustained application of the mind, with inward stillness and mental one-pointedness, without initial and sustained application of the mind, with joy and happiness born of concentration, dwells having attained the second absorption. At this time the noble disciple is reckoned to have grown buds, like the growing of the buds on the coral tree of the thirty-three gods.
復次，聖弟子離於喜欲，捨無求遊，正念正智而身覺樂，謂聖所說、聖所捨、念、樂住、空，得第三禪成就遊，是時，聖弟子名生如鳥喙，猶三十三天晝度樹如鳥喙也。	Again, the noble disciple, separated from joy and desire, dwelling in equanimity and not seeking anything, with right mindfulness and right attentiveness, experiencing pleasure with the body, dwells having attained the third absorption, which the noble ones speak of as noble equanimity and mindfulness, a happy abode. At this time the noble disciple is reckoned to have grown [buds] resembling a bird’s beak, like the [buds] resembling a bird’s beak on the coral tree of the thirty-three gods.
復次，聖弟子樂滅、苦滅，喜憂本已滅，不苦不樂、捨、念、清淨，得第四禪成就遊，是時，聖弟子名生如鉢，猶三十三天晝度樹如鉢也。	Again, the noble disciple, with the cessation of pleasure and pain, and with the earlier cessation of joy and displeasure, with neither-pain-nor-pleasure, equanimity, mindfulness, and purity, dwells having attained the fourth absorption. At this time the noble disciple is reckoned to have grown [buds] resembling bowls, like the [buds] resembling bowls on the coral tree of the thirty-three gods.
復次，聖弟子諸漏已盡，心解脫、慧解脫，於現法中自知自覺，自作證成就遊，生已盡，梵行已立，所作已辦，不更受有，知如真，是時，聖弟子名盡敷開，猶三十三天晝度樹盡敷開也。	Again, the noble disciple destroys the taints, [attains] liberation of the mind, and liberation through wisdom, and in this very life, personally attains understanding and awakening, and dwells having personally realized. He knows as it really is: Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence. At this time the noble disciple is reckoned to be in full bloom, like the full blooming of the coral tree of the thirty-three gods. 
彼為漏盡阿羅訶比丘，三十三天集在善法正殿，咨嗟稱歎：	This monk is one whose taints are destroyed, an arahant. The thirty-three gods assemble in the Hall of the True Dharma and, sighing in admiration, praise him:
『某尊弟子於某村邑剃除鬚髮，著袈裟衣，至信、捨家、無家、學道，諸漏已盡，心解脫、慧解脫，於現法中自知自覺，自作證成就遊，生已盡，梵行已立，所作已辦，不更受有，知如真。』	Venerable disciple So-and-so, from such-and-such a village or town, having shaved off [his] hair and beard, donned the yellow robe, and having left the household life out of faith to become a homeless one, having practiced the path, he has destroyed the taints. He has [attained] liberation of the mind and liberation through wisdom, and in this very life [he has] personally attained understanding and awakening, and dwells having personally realized. He knows as it really is: Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence.
是謂漏盡阿羅訶共集會也，如三十三天晝度樹下共集會也。」	This is [how] an arahant, with taints destroyed, joins the community [of liberated ones], like the assembling of the thirty-three gods beneath their coral tree.
佛說如是。	This is what the Buddha said.
彼諸比丘聞佛所說，歡喜奉行。	Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.

城喻經	The Discourse with the Parable of the [Border] Town
我聞如是：一時，佛遊舍衛國，在勝林給孤獨園。	Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.
爾時，世尊告諸比丘：「如王邊城七事具足，四食豐饒，易不難得，是故王城不為外敵破，唯除內自壞。	At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: If a king’s border town is equipped with seven things and obtains easily and without difficulty an abundance of four types of supplies, then this king’s [border] town will not be wiped out by outside enemies but only by internal self-destruction.
云何王城七事具足？	What are the seven things with which the king’s [border] town is equipped?
謂王邊城造立樓櫓，築地使堅，不可毀壞，為內安隱，制外怨敵，是謂王城一事具足。	In the king’s border town a watchtower has been constructed, built firmly in the earth, indestructible, to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies. This is the first thing with which the king’s [border] town is equipped.
復次，如王邊城掘鑿池壍，極使深廣，修備可依，為內安隱，制外怨敵，是謂王城二事具足。	Again, for the king’s border town a moat has been excavated, very deep and wide, well designed and reliable, to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies. This is the second thing with which the king’s [border] town is equipped.
復次，如王邊城周匝通道，開除平博，為內安隱，制外怨敵，是謂王城三事具足。	Again, the king’s border town is surrounded by a road that is open and clear, level and wide, to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies. This is the third thing with which the king’s [border] town is equipped.
復次，如王邊城集四種軍力，，為內安隱，制外怨敵，是謂王城四事具足。	Again, the king’s border town has raised an army with the four divisions—elephant troops, cavalry, chariot troops, and infantry—to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies. This is the fourth thing with which the king’s [border] town is equipped.
復次，如王邊城豫備軍器弓、矢、鉾、戟，為內安隱，制外怨敵，是謂王城五事具足。	Again, the king’s border town has been provided with weapons— bows and arrows, swords and spears—to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies. This is the fifth thing with which the king’s [border] town is equipped.
復次，如王邊城立守門大將，明略智辯，勇毅奇謀，善則聽入，不善則禁，為內安隱，制外怨敵，是謂王城六事具足。	Again, in the king’s border town a general has been appointed as gatekeeper, one who is sharp-witted and wise in making decisions, brave and resolute, of excellent counsel, who allows entry to the good and keeps out the bad, to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies. This is the sixth thing with which the king’s [border] town is equipped.
復次，如王邊城築立高墻，令極牢固，泥塗堊灑，為內安隱，制外怨敵，是謂王城七事具足也。	Again, for the king’s border town a high rampart has been constructed, extremely solid, plastered with mud and painted with whitewash, to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies. This is the seventh thing with which the king’s [border] town is equipped.
「云何王城四食豐饒，易不難得？	What are the four kinds of supplies that the king’s [border] town obtains in abundance, easily and without difficulty?
謂王邊城水草樵木，資有豫備，為內安隱，制外怨敵，是謂王城一食豐饒，易不難得。	The king’s border town has been provided with plentiful quantities of water, grass, and firewood, to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies. This is the first kind of supplies that the king’s [border] town obtains in abundance, easily and without difficulty.
復次，如王邊城多收稻穀及儲畜麥，為內安隱，制外怨敵，是謂王城二食豐饒，易不難得。	Again, the king’s border town has harvested plenty of rice and stored up plenty of wheat, to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies. This is the second kind of supplies that the king’s [border] town obtains in abundance, easily and without difficulty.
復次，如王邊城多積秥豆及大小豆，為內安隱，制外怨敵，是謂王城三食豐饒，易不難得。	Again, the king’s border town has amassed plenty of grain and beans of various sorts, to ensure peace within and control outside enemies. This is the third kind of supplies that the king’s [border] town obtains in abundance, easily and without difficulty.
復次，如王邊城畜酥油、蜜及甘蔗、餹、魚、鹽、脯肉，一切具足，為內安隱，制外怨敵，是謂王城四食豐饒，易不難得。	Again, the king’s border town has stored up ghee, honey, sugarcane, sugar, fish, salt, and dried meat, is equipped with all of these, to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies. This is the fourth kind of supplies that the king’s [border] town obtains in abundance, easily and without difficulty.
如是王城七事具足，四食豐饒，易不難得，不為外敵破，唯除內自壞。	Such a king’s [border] town, equipped with [these] seven things and having obtained easily and without difficulty an abundance of [these] four kinds of supplies, will not be wiped out by outside enemies but only by internal selfdestruction.
如是，若聖弟子亦得七善法，逮四增上心，易不難得， 是故聖弟子不為魔王之所得便，亦不隨惡不善之法，不為染污所染，不復更受生也。	In the same way, if a noble disciple gains seven wholesome qualities and attains four higher states of mind easily and without difficulty, then for this reason the noble disciple will be beyond the reach of King Māra, will not be influenced by evil and unwholesome states, will not be defiled by defilements, and will not be born again.
云何聖弟子得七善法？	How does a noble disciple gain seven wholesome qualities?
謂聖弟子得堅固信，深著如來，信根已立，終不隨外沙門、梵志，若天、魔、梵及餘世間，是謂聖弟子得一善法。	A noble disciple gains firm faith that is deeply settled in the Tathāgata, faith with firm roots that cannot be influenced by non-Buddhist renunciants or brahmins, or by gods, Māras, Brahmās, or anyone else in the world. This is how the noble disciple gains the first wholesome quality.
復次，聖弟子常行慚耻，可慚知慚，惡不善法穢汙煩惱，受諸惡報，造生死本，是謂聖弟子得二善法。	Again, the noble disciple has at all times a sense of shame. What is shameful he knows as shameful, [namely,] evil and unwholesome states, which pollute and defile, which have various evil consequences and create the root cause of birth and death. This is how the noble disciple gains the second wholesome quality.
復次，聖弟子常行羞愧，可愧知愧，惡不善法穢汙煩惱，受諸惡報，造生死本，是謂聖弟子得三善法。	Again, the noble disciple continuously fears wrongdoing. What is wrong he knows as wrong, [namely,] evil and unwholesome states, which pollute and defile, which will have various evil consequences and create the root cause of birth and death. This is how the noble disciple gains the third wholesome quality.
復次，聖弟子常行精進，斷惡不善，修諸善法，恒自起意，專一堅固，為諸善本，不捨方便，是謂聖弟子得四善法。	Again, the noble disciple continuously applies effort, cutting off what is evil and unwholesome and cultivating wholesome states. He constantly arouses his mind, is single-minded and steadfast regarding the roots of wholesomeness, without giving up his task. This is how the noble disciple gains the fourth wholesome quality.
復次，聖弟子廣學多聞，守持不忘，積聚博聞，所謂法者，初善、中善、竟亦善，有義有文，具足清淨，顯現梵行，如是諸法廣學多聞，翫習至千，意所惟觀，明見深達，是謂聖弟子得五善法。	Again, the noble disciple studies widely and learns much, retaining and not forgetting it, accumulating broad learning of what is called the Dharma, which is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, which has [proper] meaning and expression, is endowed with purity, and reveals the holy life. In this way he studies widely and learns much regarding all the teachings, familiarizing himself with them even a thousand times, considering and contemplating them with knowledge, vision, and profound penetration. This is how the noble disciple gains the fifth wholesome quality.
復次，聖弟子常行於念，成就正念，久所曾習，久所曾聞，恒憶不忘，是謂聖弟子得六善法。	Again, the noble disciple continuously practices mindfulness, achieves right mindfulness, always recalling and not forgetting what was done or heard long ago. This is how the noble disciple gains the sixth wholesome quality.
復次，聖弟子修行智慧，觀興衰法，得如此智，聖慧明達，分別曉了，以正盡苦，是謂聖弟子得七善法也。	Again, the noble disciple develops comprehension and wisdom, attains understanding concerning the rise and fall of phenomena, attains noble penetrative knowledge and discriminative understanding concerning the true cessation of suffering. This is how the noble disciple gains the seventh wholesome quality.
云何聖弟子逮四增上心，易不難得？	How does the noble disciple attain four higher states of mind, easily and without difficulty?
謂聖弟子離欲、離惡不善之法，有覺、有觀，離生喜樂，逮初禪成就遊，是謂聖弟子逮初增上心，易不難得。	Separated from desires, separated from evil and unwholesome states, with initial and sustained application of the mind, with joy and happiness born of separation, the noble disciple dwells having attained the first absorption. This is how the noble disciple attains the first higher state of mind, easily and without difficulty.
復次，聖弟子覺、觀已息，內靜、一心，無覺、無觀，定生喜樂，逮第二禪成就遊，是謂聖弟子逮第二增上心，易不難得。	Again, through the calming of initial and sustained application of the mind, with inward stillness and mental one-pointedness, without initial and sustained application of the mind, with joy and happiness born of concentration, the noble disciple dwells having attained the second absorption.This is how the noble disciple attains the second higher state of mind, easily and without difficulty. 
復次，聖弟子離於喜欲，捨無求遊，正念正智而身覺樂，謂聖所說、聖所捨、念、樂住、空，逮第三禪成就遊，是謂聖弟子逮第三增上心，易不難得。	Again, separated from joy and desire, dwelling in equanimity and not seeking anything, with right mindfulness and right attentiveness, experiencing pleasure with the body, the noble disciple dwells having attained the third absorption, which the noble ones speak of as noble equanimity and mindfulness, a happy abode. This is how the noble disciple attains the third higher state of mind, easily and without difficulty.
復次，聖弟子樂滅、苦滅，喜憂本已滅，不苦不樂、捨、念、清淨，逮第四禪成就遊，是謂聖弟子逮第四增上心，易不難得。	Again, with the cessation of pleasure and pain, and with the earlier cessation of joy and displeasure, with neither-pain-nor-pleasure, equanimity, mindfulness, and purity, the noble disciple dwells having attained the fourth absorption. This is how the noble disciple attains the fourth higher state of mind, easily and without difficulty.
如是，聖弟子得七善法，逮四增上心，易不難得， 不為魔王之所得便，亦不隨惡不善之法，不為染污所染，不復更受生。	In this way the noble disciple, who has gained seven wholesome qualities and attained four higher states of mind, easily and without difficulty, is beyond the reach of King Māra, and will not be influenced by evil and unwholesome states, will not be defiled by defilements and will not be born again.
如王邊城造立樓櫓，築地使堅，不可毀壞，為內安隱，制外怨敵。 如是，聖弟子得堅固信，深著如來，信根已立，終不隨外沙門，梵志，若天、魔、梵及餘世間，是謂聖弟子得信樓櫓，除惡不善，修諸善法也。	Just as a watchtower is constructed in the king’s border town, built firmly in the earth, indestructible, to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies—in the same way, the noble disciple gains firm faith that is deeply settled in the Tathāgata, faith with firm roots that cannot be influenced by non-Buddhist renunciants or brahmins, or by gods, Māras, Brahmās, or anyone else in the world. This is how the noble disciple gains the watchtower of faith, which removes what is evil and unwholesome and develops wholesome states.
如王邊城掘鑿池塹，極使深廣，修備可依，為內安隱，制外怨敵。如是，聖弟子常行慚耻，可慚知慚，惡不善法穢汙煩惱，受諸惡報，造生死本，是謂聖弟子得慚池塹，除惡不善，修諸善法也。	Just as a moat is excavated [around] the king’s border town, very deep and wide, well designed and reliable, to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies; in the same way, the noble disciple has at all times a sense of shame. What is shameful he knows as shameful, [namely] evil and unwholesome states, which pollute and defile, which have various evil consequences, and create the root cause of birth and death. This is how the noble disciple gains the moat of a sense of shame, which removes what is evil and unwholesome and develops wholesome states.
如王邊城周匝通道，開除平博，為內安隱，制外怨敵。如是，聖弟子常行羞愧，可愧知愧，惡不善法穢污煩惱，受諸惡報，造生死本，是謂聖弟子得愧平道，除惡不善，修諸善法也。	Just as a road surrounds the king’s border town, open and clear, level and wide, to ensure peace within and control outside enemies. In the same way, the noble disciple at all times fears wrongdoing. What is wrong he knows as wrong, [namely] evil and unwholesome states, which pollute and defile, which will have various evil consequences, which create the root cause of birth and death. This is how the noble disciple gains the level road of the fear of wrongdoing, which removes what is evil and unwholesome and develops wholesome states.
如王邊城集四種軍力，象軍、馬軍、車軍、步軍，為內安隱，制外怨敵。如是，聖弟子常行精進，斷惡不善，修諸善法，恒自起意，專一堅固，為諸善本，不捨方便，是謂聖弟子得精進軍力，除惡不善，修諸善法也。	Just as an army with four divisions is raised in the king’s border town, with elephant troops, cavalry, chariot troops, and infantry, to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies; in the same way, the noble disciple continuously applies effort, abandoning what is evil and unwholesome and cultivating wholesome states. He constantly arouses his mind, is single-minded and steadfast regarding the roots of wholesomeness, without giving up his task. This is how the noble disciple gains the army of effort, which removes what is evil and unwholesome and develops wholesome states.
如王邊城豫備軍器弓、矢、鉾、戟，為內安隱，制外怨敵。 如是，聖弟子廣學多聞，守持不忘，積聚博聞，所謂法者，初善、中善、竟亦善，有義有文，具足清淨，顯現梵行。如是諸法廣學多聞，翫習至千，意所惟觀，明見深達，是謂聖弟子得多聞軍器，除惡不善，修諸善法也。	Just as weapons are provided for the troops of the king’s border town—bows and arrows, swords and spears—to ensure peace within and control outside enemies; in the same way the noble disciple studies widely and learns much, retaining and not forgetting it, accumulating broad learning of what is called the Dharma, which is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, which has [proper] meaning and expression, is endowed with purity, and reveals the holy life; in this way he studies widely and learns much regarding all the teachings, familiarizing himself with them even a thousand times, mentally considering and contemplating them with knowledge, vision, and profound penetration. This is how the noble disciple gains the weapon of much learning, which removes what is evil and unwholesome and develops wholesome states.
如王邊城立守門大將，明略智辯，勇毅奇謀，善則聽入，不善則禁，為內安隱，制外怨敵。如是，聖弟子常行於念，成就正念，久所曾習，久所曾聞，恒憶不忘，是謂聖弟子得念守門大將，除惡不善，修諸善法也。	Just as a general is appointed as gatekeeper to the king’s border town, one who is sharp-witted and wise in making decisions, brave and resolute, of excellent counsel, who allows entry to the good and keeps out the bad, to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies; in the same way the noble disciple continuously practices mindfulness, achieves right mindfulness, always recalling and not forgetting what was done or heard long ago. This is how the noble disciple gains the gatekeeping general of mindfulness, which removes what is evil and unwholesome and develops wholesome states.
如王邊城築立高牆，令極牢固，泥塗堊灑，為內安隱，制外怨敵。如是，聖弟子修行智慧，觀興衰法，得如此智，聖慧明達，分別曉了，以正盡苦，是謂聖弟子得智慧牆，除惡不善，修諸善法也。	Just as a high rampart is constructed for the king’s border town, extremely solid, plastered with mud and painted with whitewash, to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies; in the same way the noble disciple develops comprehension and wisdom, attains understanding concerning the rise and fall of phenomena, attains noble penetrative knowledge and discriminative understanding concerning the true cessation of suffering. This is how the noble disciple gains the rampart of wisdom, which removes what is evil and unwholesome and develops wholesome states. 
如王邊城水草樵木，資有豫備，為內安隱，制外怨敵。如是，聖弟子離欲、離惡不善之法，有覺、有觀，離生喜樂，逮初禪成就遊，樂住無乏，安隱快樂，自致涅槃也。	Just as supplies of water, grass, and firewood are provided for the king’s border town to ensure peace within and control outside enemies; in the same way the noble disciple, separated from desires, separated from evil and unwholesome states, with initial and sustained application of the mind, with joy and happiness born of seclusion, dwells having attained the first absorption. He abides in a happiness that lacks nothing, a peaceful happiness that leads naturally to nirvana.
如王邊城多收稻穀及儲畜麥，為內安隱，制外怨敵。 如是，聖弟子覺、觀已息，內靜、一心，無覺、無觀，定生喜樂，逮第二禪成就遊，樂住無乏，安隱快樂，自致涅槃也。	Just as plenty of rice is harvested and plenty of wheat is stored up in the king’s border town to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies; in the same way the noble disciple, through the calming of initial and sustained application of the mind, with inward stillness and mental one-pointedness, without initial and sustained application of the mind, with joy and happiness born of concentration, dwells having attained the second absorption. He abides in a happiness that lacks nothing, a peaceful happiness that leads naturally to nirvana.
如王邊城多積秥豆及大小豆，為內安隱，制外怨敵。 如是，聖弟子離於喜欲，捨無求遊，正念正智而身覺樂，謂聖所說、聖所捨、念、樂住、空，逮第三禪成就遊，樂住無乏，安隱快樂，自致涅槃也。	Just as large amounts of grain and beans of various sorts are amassed in the king’s border town to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies; in the same way the noble disciple, separated from joy and desire, dwelling in equanimity and not seeking anything, with right mindfulness and right attentiveness, experiencing pleasure with the body, dwells having attained the third absorption, which the noble ones speak of as noble equanimity and mindfulness, a happy abode. He abides in a happiness that lacks nothing, a peaceful happiness that leads naturally to nirvana.
如王邊城畜酥油、蜜及甘蔗、餹、魚、鹽、脯肉，一切充足，為內安隱，制外怨敵。 如是，聖弟子樂滅、苦滅，喜、憂本已滅，不苦不樂、捨、念、清淨，逮第四禪成就遊，樂住無乏，安隱快樂，自致涅槃。」	Just as ghee, honey, sugarcane, sugar, fish, salt, and dried meat are stored up in the king’s border town, being equipped with all of these to ensure peace within and to control outside enemies; in the same way the noble disciple, with the cessation of pleasure and pain, and with the earlier cessation of joy and displeasure, with neither-pain-nor-pleasure, equanimity, mindfulness, and purity, dwells having attained the fourth absorption, abiding in a happiness that lacks nothing, a peaceful happiness that leads naturally to nirvana.
佛說如是。彼諸比丘聞佛所說，歡喜奉行。	This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well. 

水喻經	The Discourse with the Water Parable
我聞如是：一時，佛遊舍衛國，在勝林給孤獨園。	Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.
爾時，世尊告諸比丘：「我當為汝說七水人。諦聽，諦聽！ 善思念之。 」時，諸比丘受教而聽。	At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: I shall teach you about seven persons in the water. Listen closely, listen closely and pay careful attention! The monks listened to receive instruction.
佛言：「云何為七？	The Buddha said: What are the seven?
或有一人常臥水中；	Suppose there is a person who remains lying in the water [below the surface].
或復有人出水還沒；	And suppose there is another person who surfaces but then sinks again.
或復有人出水而住；	And suppose there is another person who surfaces and remains standing [in the water].
或復有人出水而住，住已而觀；	And suppose there is another person who surfaces and remains standing; and, having remained standing, observes.
或復有人出水而住，住已而觀，觀已而渡；	And suppose there is another person who surfaces and remains standing, and having remained standing, observes; and, having observed, crosses over [toward the farther bank].
或復有人出水而住，住已而觀，觀已而渡，渡已至彼岸；	And suppose there is another person who surfaces and remains standing; and, having remained standing, observes; and, having observed, crosses over; and, having crossed over, reaches the farther bank.
或復有人出水而住，住已而觀，觀已而渡，渡已至彼岸，至彼岸已，謂住岸人。	And suppose there is another person who surfaces and remains standing; and, having remained standing, observes; and, having observed, crosses over; and, having crossed over, reaches the farther bank; and, having reached the farther bank, is called a person dwelling on the [farther] bank.
如是，我當復為汝說七水喻人。諦聽，諦聽！ 善思念之。」	In the same way, I shall repeat to you the parable of seven persons in the water. Listen closely, listen closely and pay careful attention!
時，諸比丘受教而聽。	The monks listened to receive instruction.
佛言：「云何為七？	The Buddha said: What are the seven?
或有人常臥；	Suppose there is a person who remains lying [in the water].
或復有人出已還沒；	And suppose there is another person who, having surfaced, sinks again.
或復有人出已而住；	And suppose there is another who, having surfaced, remains standing.
或復有人出已而住，住已而觀；	And suppose there is another who, having surfaced, remains standing, and having remained standing, observes.
或復有人出已而住，住已而觀，觀已而渡；	And suppose there is another who, having surfaced, remains standing; and, having remained standing, observes; and, having observed, crosses over.
或復有人出已而住，住已而觀，觀已而渡，渡已至彼岸；	And suppose there is another who, having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; having observed, crosses over; and having crossed over, reaches the farther bank.
或復有人出已而住，住已而觀，觀已而渡，渡已至彼岸，至彼岸已，謂住岸梵志。 此七水喻人，我略說也。	And suppose there is another person who, having surfaced, remains standing, having remained standing, observes; having observed, crosses over; having crossed over, reaches the farther bank; and having reached the farther bank, is called a brahmin dwelling on the [farther] bank. I have taught in brief this parable of seven people in the water.
如上所說，如上施設。 汝知何義？ 何所分別？ 有何因緣？」	As it has been set out and described above, do you know what its meaning is, how to explain it, and what its moral is?
時，諸比丘白世尊曰：「世尊為法本，世尊為法主，法由世尊，唯願說之，我等聞已，得廣知義。」	The monks said to the World-honored One: The World-honored One is the source of the Dharma, the World-honored One is the master of the Dharma, the Dharma comes from the World-honored One. May he explain it! Having heard, we will come to know its meaning fully.
佛便告曰：「汝等諦聽！善思念之。我當為汝分別其義。 」	The Buddha said: [Then] Listen closely, listen closely and pay careful attention!I shall explain its meaning to you.
時，諸比丘受教而聽。	Then the monks listened to receive instruction.
佛言：「云何有人常臥？	The Buddha said: What is [the meaning of] the person that remains lying [in the water]?
謂或有人為不善法之所覆蓋，染汙所染，受惡法報，造生死本，是謂有人常臥。	Here, a person is obstructed by unwholesome states, defiled by defilements, experiencing the consequences of evil states, which create the root cause for birth and death. This is what is meant by the person that remains lying [in the water].
猶人沒溺，臥于水中，我說彼人亦復如是，是謂初水喻人，世間諦如有也。	Like a person who, having sunk and drowned, remains lying in the water, just so, I say, is this [defiled] person. This is what is meant by the first person in the water parable. Such [people] are really to be found in the world.
云何有人出已還沒？	What is the person who, having surfaced, sinks again?
謂人既出，得信善法，持戒、布施、多聞、智慧，修習善法，彼於後時失信不固，失持戒、布施、多聞、智慧而不堅固，是謂有人出已還沒。	Here, a person has surfaced by gaining faith in the true Dharma, keeping the precepts, practicing generosity, learning much, and [developing] wisdom, [thereby] practicing the true Dharma. At a later time, [however,] he loses faith, which [then] becomes unstable, gives up keeping the precepts, practicing generosity, learning much, and [developing] wisdom—[these practices] thus become unstable. This is what is meant by the person who, having surfaced, sinks again.
猶人溺水，既出還沒，我說彼人亦復如是，是謂第二水喻人，世間諦如有也。	Like the person who, having [nearly] drowned in the water, surfaces but then sinks again—just so, I say, is this [backsliding] person. This is what is meant by the second person in the water parable. Such people are really to be found in the world.
云何有人出已而住？	What is the person who, having surfaced, remains standing? 
謂人既出，得信善法，持戒、布施、多聞、智慧，修習善法，彼於後時信固不失，持戒、布施、多聞、智慧，堅固不失，是謂有人出已而住，猶人溺水，出已而住，我說彼人亦復如是，是謂第三水喻人，世間諦如有也。	Here, a person has surfaced by gaining faith in the true Dharma, keeping the precepts, practicing generosity, learning much, and [developing] wisdom, [thereby] practicing the true Dharma. At a later time his faith [remains] firm and is not lost, and his keeping of the precepts, practice of generosity, learning much, and [developing of] wisdom [remain] stable and firm and are not lost. This is what is meant by the person who, having surfaced, remains standing. Like the person who, having [nearly] drowned in the water, surfaces and remains standing—just so, I say, is this [stable] person. This is what is meant by the third person in the water parable.Such people are really to be found in the world.
云何有人出已而住，住已而觀？	What is the person who, having surfaced, remains standing; and, having remained standing, observes?
謂人既出，得信善法，持戒、布施、多聞、智慧，修習善法，彼於後時信固不失，持戒、布施、多聞、智慧，堅固不失，住善法中，知苦如真，知苦習、知苦滅、知苦滅道如真。	Here, a person has surfaced by gaining faith in the true Dharma, keeping the precepts, and practicing generosity, learning much, and [developing] wisdom, [thereby] practicing the true Dharma. At a later time, his faith remains firm and is not lost, and his keeping of the precepts, practice of generosity, learning much, and [developing] wisdom [remain] stable and firm and are not lost. Being established in the true Dharma, he knows suffering as it really is, knows the arising of suffering, knows the cessation of suffering, and knows the path to the cessation of suffering as it really is.
彼如是知、如是見，三結便盡，謂身見、戒取、疑，三結已盡，得須陀洹，不墮惡法，定趣正覺，極受七有，天上、人間七往來已，便得苦際，是謂有人出已而住，住已而觀。	Through such knowing and seeing, three fetters are eliminated: namely, personality view, clinging to precepts, and doubt; and through the cessation of these three fetters, he attains stream-entry. He is assured of progress toward full awakening within at most seven existences, without falling into evil states. Having passed through [at most] seven existences in heavenly or human realms, he will attain the ending of suffering. This is what is meant by the person who having surfaced, remains standing, and having remained standing, observes.
猶人溺水，出已而住，住已而觀，我說彼人亦復如是，是謂第四水喻人，世間諦如有也。	Like the person who, having [nearly] drowned in the water and having surfaced remains standing, and having remained standing observes—just so, I say, is this person [who attains streamentry]. This is what is meant by the fourth person in the water parable. Such people are really to be found in the world.
云何有人出已而住，住已而觀，觀已而渡？	What is the person who, having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; and having observed, crosses over?
謂人既出，得信善法，持戒、布施、多聞、智慧，修習善法。	Here, a person has surfaced by gaining faith in the true Dharma, keeping the precepts, practicing generosity, learning much, and [developing] wisdom, [thereby] practicing the true Dharma.
彼於後時信固不失，持戒，布施、多聞、智慧，堅固不失，住善法中，知苦如真，知苦習、知苦滅、知苦滅道如真，如是知、如是見，三結便盡，謂身見、戒取、疑，三結已盡，婬、怒、癡薄，得一往來天上、人間，一往來已，便得苦際，	At a later time, his faith [remains] firm and is not lost, his keeping of the precepts, practice of generosity, learning much, and [developing] wisdom [remain] stable and firm and are not lost. Being established in the true Dharma, he knows suffering as it really is, knows the arising of suffering, knows the cessation of suffering, knows the path to the cessation of suffering, as it really is. Through such knowing and seeing, three fetters are eliminated: namely, personality view, clinging to precepts, and doubt; and, having eliminated these three fetters, he [also] reduces sensual desire, anger, and ignorance, and attains once-returning. Having passed through one existence in a heavenly or human realm, he will attain the ending of suffering.
是謂有人出已而住，住已而觀，觀已而渡。猶人溺水，出已而住，住已而觀，觀已而渡，我說彼人亦復如是，是謂第五水喻人，世間諦如有也。	This is what is meant by the person who, having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; and having observed, crosses over. Like the person who, having [nearly] drowned in the water and having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; and having observed, crosses over—just so, I say, is this person [who attains once-returning]. This is what is meant by the fifth person in the water parable. Such people are really to be found in the world. 
云何有人出已而住，住已而觀，觀已而渡，渡已至彼岸？	What is the person who, having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; having observed, crosses over; and having crossed over, reaches the farther bank?
謂人既出，得信善法，持戒、布施、多聞、智慧，修習善法，彼於後時信固不失，持戒、布施、多聞、智慧，堅固不失，住善法中，知苦如真，知苦習、知苦滅、知苦滅道如真，如是知、如是見，五下分結盡，謂貪欲、瞋恚、身見、戒取、疑，五下分結盡已，生於彼間，便般涅槃，得不退法，不還此世，	Here, a person has surfaced by gaining faith in the true Dharma, keeping the precepts, practicing generosity, learning much, and [developing] wisdom, [thereby] practicing the true Dharma. At a later time his faith [remains] firm and is not lost, his keeping of the precepts, practice of generosity, learning much, and [developing] wisdom [remain] stable and firm and are not lost. Being established in the true Dharma, he knows suffering as it really is, knows the arising of suffering, knows the cessation of suffering, knows the path to the cessation of suffering as it really is. Through such knowing and seeing, the five lower fetters are eliminated—namely, lustful desire, ill will, personality view, clinging to precepts, and doubt. With these five lower fetters eliminated, he will be born in another[, heavenly] realm and there attain final nirvana, having attained the condition of non-returning, not coming back to this world.
是謂有人出已而住，住已而觀，觀已而渡，渡已至彼岸。猶人溺水，出已而住，住已而觀，觀已而渡，渡已至彼岸，我說彼人亦復如是，是謂第六水喻人，世間諦如有也。	This is what is meant by the person who, having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; having observed, crosses over; and having crossed over, reaches the farther bank. Like the person who, having [nearly] drowned in the water and having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; having observed, crosses over; and having crossed over, reaches the farther bank—just so, I say, is this person [who attains nonreturning]. This is what is meant by the sixth person in the water parable.
云何有人出已而住，住已而觀，觀已而渡，渡已至彼岸，至彼岸已謂住岸梵志？	Such people are really to be found in the world. What is the person who, having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; having observed, crosses over; having crossed over, reaches the farther bank; and having reached the farther bank, is called a brahmin dwelling on the [farther] bank?
謂人既出，得信善法，持戒、布施、多聞、智慧，修習善法，彼於後時信固不失，持戒、布施、多聞、智慧，堅固不失，住善法中，知苦如真，知苦習、知苦滅、知苦滅道如真，如是知、如是見，欲漏心解脫，有漏、無明漏心解脫，	Here, a person has surfaced by gaining faith in the true Dharma, keeping the precepts, practicing generosity, learning much, and [developing] wisdom, [thereby] practicing the true Dharma. At a later time, his faith [remains] firm and is not lost, his keeping of the precepts, practice of generosity, learning, and [developing] wisdom are stable and firm and are not lost. Being established in the true Dharma, he knows suffering as it really is, knows the arising of suffering, knows the cessation of suffering, and knows the path [leading] to the cessation of suffering as it really is. Through such knowing and seeing, he attains liberation of the mind from the taint of desire, from the taint of becoming, and from the taint of ignorance.
解脫已，便知解脫，生已盡，梵行已立，所作已辦，不更受有，知如真，是謂有人出已而住，住已而觀，觀已而渡，渡已至彼岸，至彼岸已，謂住岸梵志。猶人溺水，出已而住，住已而觀，觀已而渡，渡已至彼岸，至彼岸已，謂住岸人。	Being liberated, he knows he is liberated; he knows as it really is: Birth is ended, the holy life has been established, what was to be done has been done. There will not be another existence. This is what is meant by the person who, having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; having observed, crosses over; having crossed over, reaches the farther bank; and having reached the farther bank, is called a brahmin dwelling on the [farther] bank. Like the person who, having [nearly] drowned in the water and having surfaced, remains standing; having remained standing, observes; having observed, crosses over; having crossed over, reaches the farther bank; and having reached the farther bank, is called a person standing on the [farther] bank—just so, I say, is this person [who has attained liberation].
我說彼人亦復如是，是謂第七水喻人，世間諦如有也。我向所言，當為汝說七水人者，因此故說。」	This is what is meant by the seventh person in the water parable. Such people are really to be found in the world. When I said earlier, 'I shall teach you about seven persons in the water,' it was on account of this that I said it.
佛說如是。彼諸比丘聞佛所說，歡喜奉行。	This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well. 

木積喻經	The Discourse with the Parable of the Heap of Wood
我聞如是：一時，佛遊拘薩羅，在人間，與大比丘眾翼從而行。	Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha, while dwelling among the people of Kosala, was traveling accompanied by a great gathering of monks.
爾時，世尊則於中路，忽見一處有大木積，洞燃俱熾，世尊見已，便下道側，更就餘樹敷尼師檀，結加趺坐。	At that time the World-honored One, while on the road, suddenly saw in a certain place a great heap of wood, all ablaze, intensely hot. On seeing it, the World-honored One went down from the side of the road, spread his sitting mat under a tree, and sat down cross-legged. Having seated himself, the World-honored One addressed the monks:
世尊坐已，告諸比丘：「汝等見彼有大木積洞燃俱熾耶？ 」時，諸比丘答曰：「見也。 世尊！」	Do you see that great heap of wood, all ablaze, intensely hot? The monks answered:We see it, World-honored One. 
世尊復告諸比丘曰：「於汝意云何？謂大木積洞燃俱熾，若抱、若坐、若臥，謂剎利女，梵志、居士、工師女，年在盛時，沐浴香薰，著明淨衣，華鬘、瓔珞嚴飾其身，若抱、若坐、若臥，何者為樂？」	The World-honored One said to the monks: What do you think? To embrace, or to sit or lie [beside] that great heap of wood, all ablaze, intensely hot; or to embrace, or to sit or lie [beside] a woman from the khattiya, brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes], a woman who is in the full bloom of youth, who has bathed and perfumed herself, has put on bright, clean clothes, is wearing garlands, and has adorned her body with jeweled necklaces—which [of these two] would be the more pleasurable?
時，諸比丘白曰：「世尊！謂大木積洞燃俱熾，若抱、若坐、若臥，甚苦。 世尊！謂剎利女，梵志、居士、工師女，年在盛時，沐浴香薰，著明淨衣，華鬘、瓔珞嚴飾其身，若抱、若坐、若臥，甚樂。 世尊！」	The monks answered: World-honored One, to embrace, or to sit or lie [beside] that great heap of wood, all ablaze, intensely hot—that would be very painful. World-honored One, to embrace, or to sit or lie [beside] a woman from the khattiya, brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes], who is in the full bloom of youth, who has bathed and perfumed herself, has put on bright clean clothes, is wearing flowers in her hair, and has adorned her body with jeweled necklaces—that, World-honored One, would be very pleasurable.
世尊告曰：「我為汝說，不令汝等學沙門失沙門道。	The World-honored One said: I tell you: while training as a renunciant, do not lose the path of the renunciant.

Although one would, because of that, experience suffering or even death, yet, one would not, when the body breaks up and life ends, go to a bad realm and be born in hell.
若愚癡人犯戒不精進，生惡不善法，非梵行稱梵行，非沙門稱沙門；若抱剎利女，梵志、居士、工師女，年在盛時，沐浴香薰，著明淨衣，華鬘、瓔珞嚴飾其身，若坐、若臥者，彼愚癡人因是長夜不善不義，受惡法報，身壞命終，趣至惡處，生地獄中。	If an ignorant person violates the precepts and is lax, giving rise to evil and unwholesome states, not practicing the holy life though professing to practice it, not a renunciant though professing to be a renunciant, if he embraces or sits or lies [beside] a woman from the khattiya, brahmin, merchant, or worker [castes], who is in the full bloom of youth, who has bathed and perfumed herself, has put on bright clean clothes, is wearing garlands, and has adorned her body with jeweled necklaces—that ignorant person will, because of this unwholesome and unbeneficial [conduct], experience the fruits of his evil states for a long time. When the body breaks up and life ends, he will go to a bad realm of existence and be born in hell. 
是故汝等當觀自義、觀彼義、觀兩義，當作是念：『我出家學，不虛不空，有果有報，有極安樂，生諸善處而得長壽，受人信施衣被、飲食、床褥、湯藥，令諸施主得大福祐，得大果報，得大光明者。』	For this reason you should contemplate your own benefit, the benefit of others, and the benefit of both, reflecting thus: My leaving the household life to train is not in vain, not empty. It has results and fruits that are very agreeable, leading to a long life and to rebirth in good realms of existence.

爾時，世尊告諸比丘：「我當為汝說七善人所往至處及無餘涅槃。諦聽，諦聽！ 善思念之。」時，諸比丘受教而聽。	At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: I shall teach you about the seven destinations of good persons and about nirvana without remainder. Listen closely, listen closely and pay careful attention! The monks listened to receive instruction.
佛言：「云何為七？ 比丘行當如是：我者無我，亦無我所，當來無我，亦無我所，已有便斷，已斷得捨，有樂不染，合會不著。	The Buddha said: What are the seven? A monk practices thus: There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self. What has already come to exist will be abandoned; when it has been abandoned, equanimity will be attained; [I shall be] neither defiled by delight in existence nor attached to contact [through the senses].
如是行者，無上息迹慧之所見，然未得證。比丘行如是，往至何所？	Such a practitioner sees the unsurpassable state of peace through his wisdom, but has not yet attained [final] realization. Practicing thus, to which destination will such a monk go? 
譬如燒䴸，纔燃便滅。當知，比丘亦復如是，	It is just like a burning wheat husk which, having caught fire, quickly exhausts itself. You should know that this monk is like that.
少慢未盡，五下分結已斷，得中般涅槃，是謂第一善人所往至處，世間諦如有。	Having cut off the five lower fetters, but with a remnant of conceit not yet extinguished, he attains final nirvana [immediately after entering] the intermediate state of existence. This is the first destination of good persons, who are indeed to be found in the world.
復次，比丘行當如是：我者無我，亦無我所，當來無我，亦無我所，已有便斷，已斷得捨，有樂不染，合會不著。	Again, a monk practices thus:There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self. What has already come to exist will be abandoned; and when it has been abandoned, equanimity will be attained. [I shall be] neither defiled by delight in existence nor attached to contact [through the senses].
行如是者，無上息迹慧之所見，然未得證。比丘行如是，往至何所？	Such a practitioner sees the unsurpassable state of peace through his wisdom, but has not yet attained [final] realization. Practicing thus, to which destination will such a monk go?
譬若如鐵洞燃俱熾，以椎打之，迸火飛空，上已即滅。 當知，比丘亦復如是	It is just as when [a slab of] iron that is all ablaze, intensely hot, is hit with a hammer, a burning splinter flies up into the air, but on moving upward, becomes extinguished immediately. You should know that this monk is like that.
少慢未盡，五下分結已斷，得中般涅槃，是謂第二善人所往至處，世間諦如有。	Having cut off the five lower fetters, but with a remnant of conceit not yet extinguished, he attains final nirvana [after a short while spent in] the intermediate state of existence. This is the second destination of good persons, really to be found in the world.
復次，比丘！行當如是：我者無我，亦無我所，當來無我，亦無我所，已有便斷，已斷得捨，有樂不染，合會不著。	Again, a monk practices thus: There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self. What has already come to exist will be abandoned; and when it has been abandoned, equanimity will be attained. [I shall be] neither defiled by delight in existence nor attached to contact [through the senses].
行如是者，無上息迹慧之所見，然未得證。比丘行如是，往至何所？ 譬若如鐵洞燃俱熾，以椎打之，迸火飛空，從上來還，未至地滅。	Such a practitioner sees the unsurpassable state of peace through his wisdom, but has not yet attained [final] realization.Practicing thus, to which destination will such a monk go? It is just as when [a slab of] iron that is all ablaze, intensely hot, is hit with a hammer, a burning splinter flies up into the air, which, having moved upward comes back down, but becomes extinguished before hitting the ground.
當知，比丘亦復如是，少慢未盡，五下分結已斷，得中般涅槃，是謂第三善人所往至處，世間諦如有。	You should know that this monk is like that.Having cut off the five lower fetters, but with a remnant of conceit not yet extinguished, he attains final nirvana [after spending some time in] the intermediate state of existence. This is the third destination of good persons, really to be found in the world.
復次，比丘行當如是：我者無我，亦無我所，當來無我，亦無我所，已有便斷，已斷得捨，有樂不染，合會不著。	Again, a monk practices thus: There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self. What has already come to exist will be abandoned; and when it has been abandoned, equanimity will be attained. [I shall be] neither defiled by delight in existence nor attached to contact [through the senses].
行如是者，無上息迹慧之所見，然未得證。比丘行如是，往至何所？	Such a practitioner sees the unsurpassable state of peace through his wisdom, but has not yet attained [final] realization. Practicing thus, to which destination will such a monk go?
譬若如鐵洞然俱熾，以椎打之，迸火飛空，墮地而滅。 當知，比丘！	It is just as when [a slab of] iron that is all ablaze, intensely hot, is hit with a hammer, a burning splinter flies up into the air, and becomes extinguished on hitting the ground. You should know that this monk is like that.
亦復如是，少慢未盡，五下分結已斷，得生般涅槃，是謂第四善人所往至處，世間諦如有。	Having cut off the five lower fetters, but with a remnant of conceit not yet extinguished, he attains final nirvana in his next existence. This is the fourth destination of good persons, really to be found in the world.
復次，比丘行當如是：我者無我，亦無我所，當來無我，亦無我所，已有便斷，已斷得捨，有樂不染，合會不著。	Again, a monk practices thus:There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self. What has already come to exist will be abandoned; and when it has been abandoned, equanimity will be attained. [I shall be] neither defiled by delight in existence nor attached to contact [through the senses].
行如是者，無上息迹慧之所見，然未得證。	Such a practitioner sees the unsurpassable state of peace through his wisdom, but has not yet attained [final] realization.
比丘！ 行如是，往至何所？ 譬若如鐵洞燃俱熾，以椎打之，迸火飛空，墮少薪草上，若烟若燃，燃已便滅。	Practicing thus, to which destination will such a monk go?It is just as when [a slab of] iron that is all ablaze, intensely hot, is hit with a hammer, a burning splinter flies up into the air and then falls on a small amount of sticks and grass, causing it to smoke and burn, and becomes extinguished after that has burned out.
當知，比丘亦復如是，少慢未盡，五下分結已斷，得行般涅槃，是謂第五善人所往至處，世間諦如有。	You should know that this monk is like that.Having cut off the five lower fetters, but with a remnant of conceit not yet extinguished, he attains final nirvana with effort. This is the fifth destination of good persons, really to be found in the world.
復次，比丘！行當如是：我者無我，亦無我所，當來無我，亦無我所，已有便斷，已斷得捨，有樂不染，合會不著。	Again, a monk practices thus: There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self. What has already come to exist will be abandoned; and when it has been abandoned, equanimity will be attained. [I shall be] neither defiled by delight in existence nor attached to contact [through the senses].
行如是者，無上息迹慧之所見，然未得證。比丘行如是，往至何所？ 譬若如鐵洞燃俱熾，以椎打之，迸火飛空，墮多薪草上，若烟若燃，燃盡已滅。	Such a practitioner sees the unsurpassable state of peace through his wisdom, but has not yet attained [final] realization. Practicing thus, to which destination will such a monk go?It is just as when [a slab of] iron that is all ablaze, intensely hot, is hit with a hammer, a burning splinter flies up into the air and then falls on a large amount of sticks and grass, causing it to smoke and burn, and becomes extinguished after that has burned out.
當知，比丘亦復如是，少慢未盡，五下分結已斷，得無行般涅槃，是謂第六善人所往至處，世間諦如有。	You should know that this monk is like that. Having cut off the five lower fetters, but with a remnant of conceit not yet extinguished, he attains final nirvana without effort. This is the sixth destination of good persons. Such people are really to be found in the world.
復次，比丘行當如是：我者無我，亦無我所，當來無我，亦無我所，已有便斷，已斷得捨，有樂不染，合會不著。	Again, a monk practices thus: There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self. What has already come to exist will be abandoned; and when it has been abandoned, equanimity will be attained. [I shall be] neither defiled by delight in existence nor attached to contact [through the senses].
行如是者，無上息迹慧之所見，然未得證。比丘行如是，往至何所？	Such a practitioner sees the unsurpassable state of peace through his wisdom, but has not yet attained [final] realization. Practicing thus, to which destination will such a monk go?
譬若如鐵洞燃俱熾，以椎打之，迸火飛空，墮多薪草上，若烟若燃，燃已便燒村邑、城郭、山林、曠野。 燒村邑、城郭、山林、曠野已，或至道、至水、至平地滅。 當知，比丘！	It is just as when [a slab of] iron that is all ablaze, intensely hot, is hit with a hammer, a burning splinter flies up into the air and falls on to a large amount of sticks and grass, causing it to smoke and burn; and after that has burned, the fire spreads to villages, towns, mountain forests, and wilderness; and having burned out the villages, towns, mountain forests, and wilderness, it reaches a road, or reaches water, or reaches level ground, and becomes extinguished.
亦復如是，少慢未盡，五下分結已斷，得上流阿迦膩吒般涅槃，是謂第七善人所往至處，世間諦如有。	You should know that this monk is like that. Having cut off the five lower fetters, but with a remnant of conceit not yet extinguished, he [first] goes upstream [all the way] to the Akaniṭṭha realm where he attains final nirvana. This is the seventh destination of good persons, really to be found in the world.
云何無餘涅槃？	What is nirvana without remainder?
比丘行當如是：我者無我，亦無我所，當來無我，亦無我所，已有便斷，已斷得捨，有樂不染，合會不著。	A monk practices thus:There is no self, nor is there anything belonging to a self; in the future there will be no self and nothing belonging to a self. What has already come to exist will be abandoned; and when it has been abandoned, equanimity will be attained. [I shall be] neither defiled by delight in existence nor attached to contact [through the senses].
行如是者，無上息迹慧之所見，而已得證。我說彼，比丘！ 不至東方，不至西方、南方、北方、四維、上、下，便於現法中息迹滅度。 「我向所說七善人所往至處及無餘涅槃者，因此故說。」	Such a practitioner sees the unsurpassable state of peace through his wisdom.Having attained [final] realization, I say, that monk will not go to the east, nor to the west, nor to the south, nor to the north, nor to [any of] the four intermediate directions, nor above, nor below, but will attain the state of peace, final nirvana, right here and now.When I said earlier, I shall teach you about the seven destinations of good persons and about nirvana without remainder, it was on account of this that I said it.
佛說如是。彼諸比丘聞佛所說，歡喜奉行。	This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.

世間福經	The Discourse on [Sources of] Worldly Merit
我聞如是：一時，佛遊拘舍彌，在瞿沙羅園 	Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Kosambī, in Ghosita’s park.
爾時，尊者摩訶周那則於晡時從宴坐起，往詣佛所，到已作禮，却坐一面，白曰：「世尊！可得施設世間福耶？ 」	At that time, in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahā Cunda rose from sitting in meditation and approached the Buddha. On arriving, he paid his respects and, sitting to one side, said: World-honored One, is it possible to describe [the nature of] worldly merit?
世尊告曰：「可得。 周那！有七世間福，得大福祐，得大果報，得大名譽，得大功德。	The World-honored One answered: It is possible, Cunda. There are seven [sources of] worldly merit that lead to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit.
云何為七？	What are the seven?
周那！ 有信族姓男、族姓女，施比丘眾房舍、堂閣。	Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family offers a dwelling place or an assembly hall to the community of monks.
周那！ 是謂第一世間之福，得大福祐，得大果報，得大名譽，得大功德。	This, Cunda, is the first [source] of worldly merit that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit.
「復次，周那！ 有信族姓男、族姓女，於房舍中施與床座、氍𭯫、𣯾𣰆、氈褥、臥具。	Again, Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family offers [to those] in that dwelling place beds, seats, woolen blankets, felt mattresses, or bedding.
周那！ 是謂第二世間之福，得大福祐，得大果報，得大名譽，得大功德。 	This, Cunda, is the second [source] of worldly merit that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit.
復次，周那！有信族姓男、族姓女，於房舍中施與一切新淨妙衣。	Again, Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family offers to all [those] in that dwelling place new, clean robes of superior quality.
周那！是謂第三世間之福，得大福祐，得大果報，得大名譽，得大功德。 	This, Cunda, is the third [source] of worldly merit that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit.
復次，周那！有信族姓男、族姓女，於房舍中常施於眾朝粥、中食，又以園民供給使令，若風雨寒雪，躬往園所，增施供養。 諸比丘眾食已，不患風雨寒雪沽漬衣服，晝夜安樂禪寂思惟。	Again, Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family constantly offers to the community in that dwelling place morning rice gruel and the midday meal … provides monastic park attendants to serve them … personally approaches the monastic park to make still more offerings, regardless of wind or rain, cold or snow … [ensures that after] the monks have eaten, their robes do not get soaked by wind or rain, cold or snow, [so that they can] enjoy meditation and quiet reflection by day and by night.
周那！是謂第七世間之福，得大福祐，得大果報，得大名譽，得大功德。	This, Cunda, is the seventh [source] of worldly merit that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit.
周那！信族姓男、族姓女已得此七世間福者，若去若來，若立若坐，若眠若覺，若晝若夜，其福常生，轉增轉廣。	Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family who has attained these seven [sources] of worldly merit, whether going or coming, whether standing or sitting, whether sleeping or awake, whether by day or by night, their merit will continuously grow, increase, and become more extensive.
周那！譬如恒伽水，從源流出，入于大海，於其中間轉深轉廣。 周那！ 如是信族姓男、族姓女已得此七世間福者，若去若來，若立若坐，若眠若覺，若晝若夜，其福常生，轉增轉廣。」	Cunda, just as, from its emergence at its source to its entry into the great ocean, the river Ganges becomes increasingly deep and increasingly wide, in the same way, Cunda, the merit of a faithful son or daughter of good family who has attained these seven [sources] of worldly merit, whether going or coming, whether standing or sitting, whether sleeping or awake, whether by day or by night, will continuously grow, increase, and become more extensive.
於是，尊者摩訶周那即從坐起，偏袒右肩，右膝著地，長跪叉手白曰：「世尊！ 可得施設出世間福耶？」	Thereupon, Venerable Mahā Cunda rose from his seat and, having bared his right shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground and, placing his palms together [in respect], said: World-honored One, is it possible to describe [the nature of] merit that transcends the world? The World-honored One answered:
世尊告曰：「可得。周那！ 更有七福出於世間，得大福祐，得大果報，得大名譽，得大功德。	It is possible, Cunda. There are also seven [sources of] merit transcending the world that lead to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit.
云何為七？	What are the seven?
周那！有信族姓男、族姓女，聞如來、如來弟子遊於某處，聞已歡喜，極懷踊躍。	Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family hears that the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata is staying in a certain place. Having heard this, they are delighted and supremely inspired.
周那！ 是謂第一出世間福，得大福祐，得大果報，得大名譽，得大功德。	This, Cunda, is the first [source] of merit transcending the world that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit.
復次，周那！有信族姓男、族姓女，聞如來、如來弟子欲從彼至此，聞已歡喜，極懷踊躍。	Again, Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family hears that the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata intends to come from there to here. Having heard this, they are delighted and supremely inspired.
周那！ 是謂第二出世間福，得大福祐，得大果報，得大名譽，得大功德。	This, Cunda, is the second [source] of merit transcending the world that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit.
復次，周那！有信族姓男、族姓女，聞如來、如來弟子已從彼至此，聞已歡喜，極懷踊躍，以清淨心躬往奉見，禮敬供養，既供養已，受三自歸於佛、法及比丘眾，而受禁戒。	Again, Cunda, a faithful son or daughter of good family hears that the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata has come from there to here. Having heard this, they are delighted and supremely inspired … they personally go to see them and pay their respects with a pure mind … they present offerings to them … having paid their respects and presented offerings, they perform the threefold taking of refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the community of monks (Sangha) … they take the precepts.
周那！是謂第七出世間福，得大福祐，得大果報，得大名譽，得大功德。	This, Cunda, is the seventh [source] of merit transcending the world that leads to great merit, great reward, great reputation, and great benefit.
周那！信族姓男、族姓女若得此七世間之福及更有七出世間福者，其福不可數，有爾所福，爾所福果，爾所福報，唯不可限、不可量、不可得大福之數。	Cunda, if a faithful son or daughter of good family attains these seven [sources] of worldly merit and also these seven [sources] of merit transcending the world, their merit cannot be measured [in terms of] so much merit, so much fruit of merit, so much result of merit; it just cannot be encompassed, cannot be measured. This great merit cannot be calculated.
周那！ 譬如從閻浮洲有五河流：一曰恒伽，二曰搖尤那，三曰舍勞浮，四曰阿夷羅婆提，五曰摩企，流入大海，於其中間水不可數，有爾所升斛，唯不可限，不可量、不可得大水之數。	Cunda, it is just as in [this land of] Jambudīpa there are five rivers, the Ganges being reckoned the first, the Yamunā the second, the Sarabhū the third, the Aciravatī the fourth, and the Mahī the fifth; and upon flowing into the great ocean, once within it, their water cannot be measured as so many gallons; it just cannot be encompassed, cannot be measured.
周那！如是信族姓男、族姓女若得此七世間之福及更有七出世間福者，其福不可數，有爾所福，爾所福果，爾所福報，唯不可限、不可量、不可得大福之數。」	This great water cannot be calculated. In the same way, Cunda, if a faithful son or daughter of good family attains these seven [sources of] worldly merit and again these seven [sources of] merit transcending the world, that merit cannot be measured as so much merit, so much fruit of merit, so much result of merit; it just cannot be encompassed, cannot be measured. This great merit cannot be calculated.
爾時，世尊而說頌曰：  「恒伽之河，  清淨易渡，  海多珍寶，  眾水中王。猶若河水，  世人敬奉，	Then the World-honored One spoke these verses: The river Ganges is pure and easily crossed, The ocean, with its many treasures, is king of all waters. Like the river’s water is the honor and respect of people in the world.
諸川所歸，  引入大海。 如是人者，  施衣飲食，  床㯓茵褥，  及諸坐具。 無量福報，  將至妙處，  猶若河水，  引入大海。」	[Just as] all rivers reach and enter the great ocean, So it is with people who offer robes, food and drink, Beds, couches, bedding, and seats, Measureless is the fruit of their merit, leading them to a sublime realm, Just like the rivers’ water entering the great ocean.
佛說如是。尊者摩訶周那及諸比丘，聞佛所說，歡喜奉行。	This is what the Buddha said. Venerable Mahā Cunda and the [other] monks heard the Buddha’s words, were delighted, and remembered them well.


七日經	The Discourse on Seven Suns
我聞如是：一時，佛遊鞞舍離，在㮈氏樹園。	Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī, in Ambapālī’s Grove.
爾時，世尊告諸比丘：「一切行無常，不久住法、速變易法、不可猗法，如是諸行不當樂著，當患厭之，當求捨離，當求解脫。所以者何？	At that time the World-honored One addressed the monks: All formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them. Why is that? 	
有時不雨，當不雨時，一切諸樹、百穀、藥木皆悉枯槁，摧碎滅盡，不得常住。	There will be a time when it will not rain. At that time when it does not rain, all the trees, the hundreds of grains, and all medicinal shrubs will wither entirely, come to destruction and extinction, unable to continue existing.
是故一切行無常，不久住法、速變易法、不可猗法，如是諸行不當樂著，當患厭之，當求捨離，當求解脫。	This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them.
復次，有時二日出世，二日出時，諸溝渠川流皆悉竭盡，不得常住。	Again, there will be a time when a second sun will appear in the world. When the second sun appears, the flow of all the streams and rivulets will become exhausted, unable to continue existing.
是故一切行無常，不久住法、速變易法、不可猗法，如是諸行不當樂著，當患厭之，當求捨離，當求解脫。	This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them.
復次，有時三日出世，三日出時，諸大江河皆悉竭盡，不得常住。	Again, there will be a time when a third sun appears in the world. When the third sun appears, all the great rivers will become exhausted, unable to continue existing.
是故一切行無常，不久住法、速變易法，不可猗法，如是諸行不當樂著，當患厭之，當求捨離，當求解脫。	This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them.
復次，有時四日出世，四日出時，諸大泉源從閻浮洲五河所出：一曰恒伽，二曰搖尤那，三曰舍牢浮，四曰阿夷羅婆提，五曰摩企，彼大泉源皆悉竭盡，不得常住。	Again, there will be a time when a fourth sun appears in the world. When the fourth sun appears, the great springs from which the five rivers of Jambudīpa emerge—the Ganges being the first, the Yamunā the second, the Sarabhū the third, the Aciravatī the fourth, and the Mahī the fifth—those great springs will all become exhausted, unable to continue existing.
是故一切行無常，不久住法、速變易法，不可猗法，如是諸行不當樂著，當患厭之，當求捨離，當求解脫。	This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them.
復次，有時五日出世，五日出時，大海水減一百由延，轉減乃至七百由延；	Again, there will be a time when a fifth sun appears in the world. When the fifth sun appears, the water of the great ocean will recede by one hundred leagues, and continue receding gradually until it is [only] seven hundred leagues [in extent].
五日出時，海水餘有七百由延，轉減乃至一百由延；五日出時，大海水減一多羅樹，轉減乃至七多羅樹；	When the fifth sun appears, and the remaining water in the ocean is [only] seven hundred leagues [in extent], it will continue receding gradually until it is [only] one hundred leagues [in extent]. When the fifth sun appears, the water of the great ocean will decrease [by the height of] one palm tree, and continue decreasing gradually until it has [a depth of only] seven palm trees.
五日出時，海水餘有七多羅樹，轉減乃至一多羅樹；	When the fifth sun appears and the remaining water in the ocean has [a depth of only] seven palm trees, it will continue decreasing gradually until it has [a depth of only] a single palm tree.
五日出時，海水減一人，轉減乃至七人；	When the fifth sun appears, the water of the great ocean will decrease [by the height of] a person, and continue decreasing gradually until it has [a depth of only] seven persons.
五日出時，海水餘有七人，轉減乃至一人；	When the fifth sun appears and the remaining water in the ocean has [a depth of only] seven persons, it will again decrease gradually until it has [a depth of only] one person.
五日出時，海水減至頸、至肩、至腰、至[月*奇][月*奇]、至膝、至踝，有時海水消盡，不足沒指。	When the fifth sun appears, the water in the ocean will decrease to the level of a person’s neck, to the level of the shoulders, of the waist, of the hips, of the knees, to the level of the ankles, and [eventually] there will be a time when the water of the ocean will be completely exhausted, being not sufficient to submerge [even] one finger.
是故一切行無常，不久住法、速變易法、不可猗法，如是諸行不當樂著，當患厭之，當求捨離，當求解脫。	This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations; one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them.
復次，有時六日出世，六日出時，一切大地須彌山王皆悉烟起，合為一烟，譬如陶師始爨竈時，皆悉烟起，合為一烟。	Again, there will be a time when a sixth sun appears in the world. When the sixth sun appears, the whole great earth, together with Meru, king of mountains, will be totally submerged in smoke, a single mass of smoke.
如是六日出時，一切大地須彌山王皆悉烟起，合為一烟。	Just as a potter’s kiln, at the time of being ignited, is totally submerged in smoke, a single mass of smoke—in the same way, when the sixth sun appears, the whole great earth, together with Meru, king of mountains, will be totally submerged in smoke, a single mass of smoke.
是故一切行無常，不久住法、速變易法，不可猗法，如是諸行不當樂著，當患厭之，當求捨離，當求解脫。	This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them.
復次，有時七日出世，七日出時，一切大地須彌山王洞燃俱熾，合為一㷿；	Again, there will be a time when a seventh sun appears in the world. When the seventh sun appears, the whole great earth, together with Meru, king of mountains, will be all ablaze, intensely hot, a single mass of flame.
如是七日出時，一切大地須彌山王洞燃俱熾，合為一㷿，風吹火㷿，乃至梵天。	In this way, when the seventh sun appears and the whole great earth, together with Meru, king of mountains, is all ablaze, intensely hot, a single mass of flame, [then] the wind will carry the flames even up to the Brahmā world.
是時，晃昱諸天始生天者，不諳世間成敗，不見世間成敗，不知世間成敗，見大火已，皆恐怖毛竪而作是念：	Then the gods of radiance, who have just been born as gods and have never experienced, seen, or known the world’s [cyclic] creation and destruction, on seeing that great fire will all be terrified, with their hair standing on end, and will think:
『火不來至此耶？火不來至此耶？』	The fire will not reach up to here, will it? The fire will not reach up to here, will it?
前生諸天諳世間成敗，見世間成敗，知世間成敗，見大火已，慰勞諸天曰：『莫得恐怖，火法齊彼，終不至此。』	Those who were born as gods at an earlier time and have experienced, seen, and known the world’s [cyclic] creation and destruction will, on seeing that great fire, calm the distress of those gods, telling them, Don’t be afraid! That fire is of such a nature that it will not reach up to here.
七日出時，須彌山王百由延崩散壞滅盡，二百由延、三百由延，乃至七百由延崩散壞滅盡；	When the seventh sun appears, Meru, king of mountains, will collapse, will be completely destroyed and cease to be, [decreasing in height by] one hundred leagues, two hundred leagues, three hundred leagues, and so on until [decreasing in height by] seven hundred leagues, it will be completely destroyed and cease to be.
七日出時，須彌山王及此大地燒壞消滅，無餘栽燼，如燃酥油，煎熬消盡，無餘烟墨； 如是七日出時，須彌山王及此大地無餘烖燼。	When the seventh sun appears, Meru, king of mountains, together with this great earth, will be burned to destruction and extinction, with not even ash remaining. Just as hot ghee or oil that is cooked or fried until it is completely exhausted and not even smoke or soot remains, in the same way, when the seventh sun appears, Meru, king of mountains, together with the great earth, will be [exhausted] with not even ash remaining.
是故一切行無常，不久住法、速變易法、不可猗法，如是諸行不當樂著，當患厭之，當求捨離，當求解脫。	This is why [I say that] all formations are impermanent, of a nature not to last, quickly changing by nature, unreliable by nature. Thus, one should not delight in or be attached to formations, one should loathe them as troublesome, one should seek to abandon them, one should seek to be free from them.
我今為汝說須彌山王當崩壞盡，誰有能信？唯見諦者耳，我今為汝說大海水當竭消盡，誰有能信？唯見諦者耳。	I have now told you that Meru, king of mountains, will collapse and be completely destroyed. Who can believe this? Only those who have seen the truth. I have now told you that the water of the great ocean will be exhausted and eliminated. Who can believe this? Only those who have seen the truth.
我今為汝說一切大地當燒燃盡，誰有能信？ 唯見諦者耳。	I have now told you that the whole great earth will be burnt up and eliminated. Who can believe this? Only those who have seen the truth.
所以者何？ 比丘！昔有大師名曰善眼，為外道仙人之所師宗，捨離欲愛，得如意足。	Why is that? Monks, in ancient times there was a great teacher called Sunetta. He was the teacher of a school of non-Buddhist seers. Abandoning sensual desire, he had attained the bases of supernormal powers.
善眼大師有無量百千弟子，善眼大師為諸弟子說梵世法，若善眼大師為說梵世法時，諸弟子等有不具足奉行法者，彼命終已，或生四王天，或生三十三天，或生㷿摩天，或生兜率哆天，或生化樂天，或生他化樂天。	The great teacher Sunetta had countless hundreds of thousands of disciples. The great teacher Sunetta gave his disciples teachings about [the way to] the Brahmā world. When the great teacher Sunetta gave teachings about the [way to] the Brahmā world, some of his disciples did not adequately put his teaching into practice. At the end of life, some of them were reborn among the four great kings, some were reborn among the thirty-three gods, some were reborn among the Yama gods, some were reborn among the Tusita gods, some were reborn among the gods who delight in creating, and some were reborn among the gods who delight in the creations of others.
若善眼大師為說梵世法時，諸弟子等設有具足奉行法者，彼修四梵室，捨離於欲，彼命終已，得生梵天。	If, when the great teacher Sunetta gave teachings about the [way to] the Brahmā world, all the disciples had remembered them well, they would have practiced the four divine abodes and, overcoming sensual desire, would, at the end of life, have attained rebirth in the Brahmā world.
彼時善眼大師而作是念：『我不應與弟子等同俱至後世共生一處，我今寧可更修增上慈。』	At that time the great teacher Sunetta had this thought, In my next life I should not be reborn in the same place as my disciples. I would now rather develop and cultivate loving-kindness.
修增上慈已，命終得生晃昱天中。	Having developed and cultivated loving-kindness, at the end of life he attained rebirth among the gods of radiance.
彼時善眼大師則於後時更修增上慈，修增上慈已，命終得生晃昱天中。	At that time, the great teacher Sunetta developed and cultivated loving-kindness, and, having developed and cultivated loving-kindness, at the end of life I attained rebirth among the gods of radiance.
善眼大師及諸弟子學道不虛，得大果報。 	The practice of the path by the great teacher Sunetta and his disciples was not in vain; they obtained great reward.
諸比丘！於意云何？	Monks, what do you think?
昔善眼大師為外道仙人之所師宗，捨離欲愛，得如意足者，汝謂異人耶？	The great teacher in ancient times called Sunetta, who was the teacher of a school of non-Buddhist seers and who, overcoming sensual desire, attained the bases of supernormal powers, do you think this was someone else?
莫作斯念，當知即是我也。	Do not think that. Know that it was me.
我於爾時名善眼大師，為外道仙人之所師宗，捨離欲愛，得如意足；	At that time I was called Sunetta, a great teacher, the leader of a school of non-Buddhist seers. Overcoming sensual desire, I attained supernormal powers.
我於爾時有無量百千弟子，我於爾時為諸弟子說梵世法。	I had countless hundreds of thousands of disciples. I gave my disciples teachings about [the way to] the Brahmā world.
我說梵世法時，諸弟子等有不具足奉行法者，彼命終已，或生四王天，或生三十三天，或生㷿摩天，或生兜率哆天，或生化樂天，或生他化樂天。	When I gave teachings about the [way to] the Brahmā world, not all of my disciples adequately put my teaching into practice. At the end of life, some were reborn among the four great kings, some were reborn among the thirty-three gods, some were reborn among the Yama gods, some were reborn among the Tusita gods, some were reborn among the gods who delight in creating, and some were reborn among the gods who delight in the creations of others.
我說梵世法時，諸弟子等設有具足奉行法者，修四梵室，捨離於欲，彼命終已，得生梵天。	When I gave teachings about the [way to] the Brahmā world, if all of my disciples had put my teaching into practice, they would have developed the four divine abodes and, overcoming sensual desire, at the end of life they would have attained rebirth in the Brahmā world.
我於爾時而作是念：『我不應與弟子等同俱至後世共生一處，我今寧可更修增上慈。』	At that time I had this thought, It is not proper for me to be reborn in the next world in the same realm as my disciples. I would now rather develop and cultivate loving-kindness.
修增上慈已，命終得生晃昱天中。	Having developed and cultivated loving-kindness, at the end of life, I attained rebirth among the gods of radiance.
我於後時更修增上慈，修增上慈已，命終得生晃昱天中。	Later, I developed and cultivated loving-kindness and, having developed and cultivated loving-kindness, at the end of life attained rebirth among the gods of radiance.
我於爾時及諸弟子學道不虛，得大果報。	The practice of the path by me and my disciples was not in vain; we obtained great reward.
我於爾時親行斯道，為自饒益，亦饒益他，饒益多人，愍傷世間，為天、為人求義及饒益，求安隱快樂，爾時說法不至究竟，不究竟白淨，不究竟梵行，不究竟梵行訖，爾時不離生、老、病、死、啼哭、憂慼，亦未能得脫一切苦。	At that time I personally practiced that path, which was of benefit to myself and of benefit to others, benefiting many people, out of compassion for the world, seeking the advantage and benefit of gods and human beings, seeking their peace and happiness. The teaching I gave at that time did not lead to the ultimate, was not the ultimate purity, not the ultimate holy life, not the ultimate completion of the holy life. At that time I was not able to abandon birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and distress. I was not able to attain complete liberation from suffering.
比丘！ 我今出世，如來、無所著、等正覺、明行成為、善逝、世間解、無上士、道法御、天人師，號佛、眾祐；	But now, monks, I have appeared in the world as a Tathāgata, free from attachment, fully awakened, endowed with knowledge and [good] conduct, well gone, a knower of the world, an unsurpassable being, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and human beings, called Buddha, protector of the world.
我今自饒益，亦饒益他，饒益多人，愍傷世間，為天、為人求義及饒益，求安隱快樂；	I now benefit myself and benefit others, benefit many people. Out of compassion for the world I seek the advantage and benefit of gods and human beings, seek [their] peace and happiness.
我今說法得至究竟，究竟白淨，究竟梵行；	The teaching I now give leads to the ultimate, is the ultimate purity, the ultimate completion of the holy life.
究竟梵行訖，我今已離生、老、病、死、啼哭、憂慼，我今已得脫一切苦。」	I have now abandoned birth, old age, sickness, death, sorrow, and distress. I have now attained complete liberation from suffering.
佛說如是。彼諸比丘聞佛所說，歡喜奉行。	This is what the Buddha said. Having heard the Buddha’s words, the monks were delighted and remembered them well.

七車經	The Discourse on Seven Chariots 
我聞如是：一時，佛遊王舍城，在竹林精舍，與大比丘眾共受夏坐。	Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, together with a great assembly of monks who were spending the rains retreat there. 
尊者滿慈子亦於生地受夏坐。	Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta was spending the rains retreat in the [Buddha’s] native region.
是時，生地諸比丘受夏坐訖，過三月已，補治衣竟，攝衣持鉢，從生地出，向王舍城，展轉進前，至王舍城，住王舍城竹林精舍。	Then, a number of monks who had concluded the rains retreat in the [Buddha’s] native region, the three months being over, having mended their robes, they put on their robes, took their bowls, and left the [Buddha’s] native region for Rājagaha. Traveling by stages, they reached Rājagaha, where they went to stay in the Bamboo Grove.
是時，生地諸比丘詣世尊所，稽首作禮，却坐一面。	Then those monks from the [Buddha’s] native region approached the Buddha, paid their respects by bowing down their heads, and sat to one side.
世尊問曰：「諸比丘！從何所來？ 何處夏坐？ 」	The World-honored One asked them: Monks, where have you come from, and in what place did you spend the rains retreat?
生地諸比丘白曰：「世尊！從生地來，於生地夏坐。」	The monks from the [Buddha’s] native region replied: World-honored One, we have come from the [World-honored One’s] native region, having spent the rains retreat there. 
世尊問曰：「於彼生地諸比丘中，何等比丘為諸比丘所共稱譽，自少欲、知足，稱說少欲、知足； 自閑居，稱說閑居； 自精進，稱說精進； 自正念，稱說正念； 自一心，稱說一心；	The World-honored One asked them: Among the monks living in [my] native region, which monk is praised by the other monks [thus]: Having few wishes and being contented himself, he speaks [to others] in praise of having few wishes and being contented; living in seclusion himself, he speaks in praise of living in seclusion; being energetic himself, he speaks in praise of being energetic; having right mindfulness himself, he speaks in praise of right mindfulness; having mental one-pointedness himself, he speaks in praise of mental one-pointedness;
自智慧，稱說智慧； 自漏盡，稱說漏盡； 自勸發渴仰、成就歡喜，稱說勸發渴仰、成就歡喜？」	having wisdom himself, he speaks in praise of wisdom; having himself destroyed the taints, he speaks in praise of destroying the taints; having himself exhorted, inspired, and fully delighted [others], he speaks in praise of exhorting, inspiring, and fully delighting [others]?
生地諸比丘白曰：	The monks from the [Buddha’s] native region replied:
「世尊！尊者滿慈子於彼生地，為諸比丘所共稱譽，自少欲、知足，稱說少欲、知足； 自閑居，稱說閑居； 自精進，稱說精進； 自正念，稱說正念； 自一心，稱說一心；	World-honored One, the monks living in [the World-honored One’s] a native region praise Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta [thus]: Having few wishes and being contented himself, he speaks [to others] in praise of having few wishes and being contented; living in seclusion himself, he speaks in praise of living in seclusion; being energetic himself, he speaks in praise of being energetic; having right mindfulness himself, he speaks in praise of right mindfulness; having mental one-pointedness himself, he speaks in praise of mental one-pointedness;
自智慧，稱說智慧； 自漏盡，稱說漏盡； 自勸發渴仰、成就歡喜，稱說勸發渴仰、成就歡喜。」	having wisdom himself, he speaks in praise of wisdom; having himself destroyed the taints, he speaks in praise of destroying the taints; having himself exhorted, inspired, and fully delighted [others], he speaks in praise of exhorting, inspiring, and fully delighting [others].
是時，尊者舍梨子在眾中坐，尊者舍梨子作如是念：「世尊如事問彼生地諸比丘輩，生地諸比丘極大稱譽賢者滿慈子，自少欲、知足，稱說少欲、知足；	At that time, Venerable Sāriputta was seated among the assembly. Then Venerable Sāriputta thought: The World-honored One has questioned those monks from [his] native region about this matter and the monks from [his] native region have given the greatest praise to Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta [thus]: Having few wishes and being contented himself, he speaks [to others] in praise of having few wishes and being contented;
自閑居，稱說閑居；自精進，稱說精進； 自正念，稱說正念； 自一心，稱說一心；自智慧，稱說智慧； 自漏盡，稱說漏盡； 自勸發渴仰、成就歡喜，稱說勸發渴仰，成就歡喜。」	living in seclusion himself, he speaks in praise of living in seclusion; being energetic himself, he speaks in praise of being energetic; having right mindfulness himself, he speaks in praise of right mindfulness; having mental one-pointedness himself, he speaks in praise of mental one-pointedness; having wisdom himself, he speaks in praise of wisdom; having himself destroyed the taints, he speaks in praise of destroying the taints; having himself exhorted, inspired, and fully delighted [others], he speaks in praise of exhorting, inspiring, and fully delighting [others].
尊者舍梨子復作是念：「何時當得與賢者滿慈子共聚集會，問其少義，彼或能聽我之所問。」	Venerable Sāriputta thought further: When I get to meet Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, I will ask him a few things. He would probably be competent in understanding [and replying to] my questions.
爾時，世尊於王舍城受夏坐訖，過三月已，補治衣竟，攝衣持鉢，從王舍城出，向舍衛國，展轉進前，至舍衛國，即住勝林給孤獨園。	At that time the World-honored One, who had concluded the rains retreat at Rājagaha, the three months being over, having mended his robes, put on his robes and took his bowl, left Rājagaha for Sāvatthī. Traveling by stages, he reached Sāvatthī, where he went to stay in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.
尊者舍梨子與生地諸比丘於王舍城共住少日，攝衣持鉢，向舍衛國，展轉進前，至舍衛國，共住勝林給孤獨園。	[Meanwhile,] after staying for a few days at Rājagaha, Venerable Sāriputta and the monks [who had come] from the [Buddha’s] native region put on their robes, took their bowls, and left Rājagaha for Sāvatthī. Traveling by stages, they reached Sāvatthī, where they went to stay in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.
是時，尊者滿慈子於生地受夏坐訖，過三月已，補治衣竟，攝衣持鉢，從生地出，向舍衛國，展轉進前，至舍衛國，亦住勝林給孤獨園。	At that time Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, who had concluded the rains retreat in the [Buddha’s] native region, the three months being over, having mended his robes, put on his robes, took his bowl, and left the [Buddha’s] native region for Sāvatthī. Traveling by stages, he reached Sāvatthī, where he went to stay in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.
尊者滿慈子詣世尊所，稽首作禮，於如來前敷尼師檀，結加趺坐。	Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta approached the Buddha and paid his respects by bowing down his head. Then he spread his sitting mat [at some distance] in front of the Buddha and sat down cross-legged.
時，尊者舍梨子問餘比丘：「諸賢！何者是賢者滿慈子耶？」	Then Venerable Sāriputta asked some other monks: Venerable friends, is that Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta?
諸比丘白尊者舍梨子：「唯然，尊者在如來前坐，白皙隆鼻，如鸚鵡𠿘，即其人也。 」時，尊者舍梨子知滿慈子色貌已，則善記念。	The monks answered Venerable Sāriputta: That is so. The venerable one who is seated in front of the Tathāgata, with fair skin and a prominent nose resembling a parrot’s beak, that is he. Then Venerable Sāriputta, having taken note of Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta’s facial appearance, retained a clear memory of it.
尊者滿慈子過夜平旦，著衣持鉢，入舍衛國而行乞食，食訖中後，還舉衣鉢，澡洗手足，以尼師檀著於肩上，至安陀林經行之處。	When the night was over, at dawn, Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta put on his robes, took his bowl, and entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. After having taken his midday meal, he put away his robes and bowl, washed his hands and feet, put his sitting mat over his shoulder, and went to a place for walking meditation in the Blind Men’s Grove.
尊者舍梨子亦過夜平旦，著衣持鉢，入舍衛國而行乞食，食訖中後，還舉衣鉢，澡洗手足，以尼師檀著於肩上，至安陀林經行之處。	Venerable Sāriputta also, when the night was over, at dawn, put on his robes, took his bowl and entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. After having taken his midday meal, he put away his robes and bowl, washed his hands and feet, put his sitting mat over his shoulder, and went to a place for walking meditation in the Blind Men’s Grove.
時，尊者滿慈子到安陀林，於一樹下敷尼師檀，結加趺坐。	Then, when Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta had reached Blind Men’s Grove, he spread his sitting mat beneath a tree and sat down cross-legged.
尊者舍梨子亦至安陀林，離滿慈子不遠，於一樹下敷尼師檀，結加趺坐。	Venerable Sāriputta also, on reaching Blind Men’s Grove, spread his sitting mat beneath a tree not far from Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, and sat down crosslegged.
尊者舍梨子則於晡時從燕坐起，往詣尊者滿慈子所，共相問訊，却坐一面，則問尊者滿慈子曰：	In the late afternoon, after rising from sitting in meditation, Venerable Sāriputta approached Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, exchanged friendly greetings, and, sitting down to one side, asked Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta:
「賢者！從沙門瞿曇修梵行耶？」	Is the venerable one practicing the holy life under the renunciant Gotama? [Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta] replied:
答曰：「如是。」	That is so.
「云何？ 賢者！ 以戒淨故，從沙門瞿曇修梵行耶？」	How is it, venerable friend, are you practicing the holy life under the renunciant Gotama for the sake of purification of virtue? [Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta] replied:
答曰：「不也。」	Not so. 
「以心淨故、以見淨故、以疑蓋淨故、以道非道知見淨故、以道跡知見淨故、以道跡斷智淨故，從沙門瞿曇修梵行耶？」	Are you practicing the holy life under the renunciant Gotama for the sake of purification of mind… , for the sake of purification of view… , for the sake of purification [from] the hindrance of doubt… , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path… , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of the way… , for the sake of purification by knowledge of the way to abandoning? [To each question Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta] replied:
答曰：「不也。」	Not so.
又復問曰：「我向問賢者從沙門瞿曇修梵行耶？ 則言如是。	[Sāriputta] asked further: Just before, I asked the venerable one if he is practicing the holy life under the renunciant Gotama, and he said that this is so.
今問賢者以戒淨故從沙門瞿曇修梵行耶？ 便言不也。 以心淨故、以見淨故、以疑蓋淨故、以道非道知見淨故、以道跡知見淨故、以道跡斷智淨故，從沙門瞿曇修梵行耶？便言不也。然以何義，從沙門瞿曇修梵行耶？ 」	Now I have asked the venerable one if he is practicing the holy life under the renunciant Gotama for the sake of purification of virtue, and he has said Not so. [I have also asked the venerable one if] he is practicing the holy life under the renunciant Gotama for the sake of purification of mind… , for the sake of purification of view… , for the sake of purification [from] the hindrance of doubt… , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path… , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of the way… , for the sake of purification by knowledge of the way to abandoning; and [to each question] he has said, Not so. In that case, for the sake of what are you practicing the holy life under the renunciant Gotama?
答曰：「賢者！ 以無餘涅槃故。」	[Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta] replied: Venerable friend, for the sake of nirvana without remainder. 
又復問曰：「云何？賢者！ 以戒淨故，沙門瞿曇施設無餘涅槃耶？ 」	[Sāriputta] asked further: How is it, then, venerable friend? Is it for the sake of purification of virtue that the renunciant Gotama designates nirvana without remainder? 
答曰：「不也。」	[Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta] replied: Not so. 
「以心淨故、以見淨故、以疑蓋淨故、以道非道知見淨故、以道跡知見淨故、以道跡斷智淨故，沙門瞿曇施設無餘涅槃耶？」	[Sāriputta asked further]: Is it for the sake of purification of mind… , for the sake of purification of view… , for the sake of purification [from] the hindrance of doubt… , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path… , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of the way… , for the sake of purification by knowledge of the way to abandoning that the renunciant Gotama designates nirvana without remainder?
答曰：「不也。 」	[Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta] replied: Not so.
又復問曰：「我向問仁，云何賢者以戒淨故，沙門瞿曇施設無餘涅槃耶？賢者言不。以心淨故、以見淨故、以疑蓋淨故、以道非道知見淨故、以道跡知見淨故、以道跡斷智淨故，沙門瞿曇施設無餘涅槃耶？ 賢者言不。 賢者所說為是何義？云何得知？」	[Sāriputta] asked again: Just now, I asked the venerable one if it is for the sake of purification of virtue that the renunciant Gotama designates nirvana without remainder, and he replied Not so. [And I asked] is it for the sake of purification of mind… , for the sake of purification of view… , for the sake of purification [from] the hindrance of doubt… , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path… , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of the way [of practice]… , for the sake of purification by knowledge of the way to abandoning, that the renunciant Gotama designates nirvana without remainder; and [to each question] the venerable one has replied Not so. What is the meaning of what the venerable one has said? How can one come to understand it?	
答曰：「賢者！若以戒淨故，世尊沙門瞿曇施設無餘涅槃者，則以有餘稱說無餘	[Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta] replied: Venerable friend, if the World-honored One, the renunciant Gotama, were to designate nirvana without remainder for the sake of purification of virtue, then that would be to praise what is with a remainder [of clinging] as being without a remainder [of clinging].
以心淨故、以見淨故、以疑蓋淨故、以道非道知見淨故、以道跡知見淨故、以道跡斷智淨故，世尊沙門瞿曇施設無餘涅槃者，則以有餘稱說無餘。	If the World-honored One, the renunciant Gotama, were to designate nirvana without remainder for the sake of purification of mind… , for the sake of purification of view… , for the sake of purification [from] the hindrance of doubt… , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path… , for the sake of purification by knowledge and vision of the way… , for the sake of purification by knowledge of the way to abandoning, then that would be to praise what is with a remainder [of clinging] as being without a remainder [of clinging].
賢者！若離此法，世尊施設無餘涅槃者，則凡夫亦當般涅槃，以凡夫亦離此法故。	[On the other hand,] venerable friend, if the World-honored One were to designate nirvana without remainder apart from these things, then a worldling should also [be able to attain] nirvana without remainder, because a worldling is also apart from these things.
賢者！ 但以戒淨故，得心淨，以心淨故，得見淨，以見淨故，得疑蓋淨，以疑葢淨故，得道非道知見淨，以道非道知見淨故，得道跡知見淨，以道跡知見淨故，得道跡斷智淨，以道跡斷智淨故，世尊沙門瞿曇施設無餘涅槃也。 	Rather, venerable friend, [it is] through purification of virtue, [that] one attains purification of mind; through purification of mind, one attains purification of view; through purification of view, one attains purification [from] the hindrance of doubt; through purification [from] the hindrance of doubt, one attains purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path; through purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path, one attains purification by knowledge and vision of the way; through purification by knowledge and vision of the way, one attains purification by knowledge of the way to abandoning; through purification by knowledge of the way of abandoning, the World-honored One, the renunciant Gotama, designates nirvana without remainder.
賢者！復聽。	Venerable friend, listen further.
昔拘薩羅王波斯匿在舍衛國，於婆雞帝有事，彼作是念：『以何方便，令一日行，從舍衛國至婆雞帝耶？ 』	Once King Pasenadi of Kosala was in Sāvatthī and had some matter [to attend to] in Sāketa. He thought, Using what expedient means can I reach Sāketa from Sāvatthī in a single day’s journey? 
復作是念：『我今寧可從舍衛國至婆雞帝，於其中間布置七車。』爾時，即從舍衛國至婆雞帝，於其中間布置七車。	He further thought, I shall now have seven chariots arranged [along the road] from Sāvatthī to Sāketa. So, he had seven chariots arranged [along the road] from Sāvatthī to Sāketa.
布七車已，從舍衛國出，至初車，乘初車，至第二車，捨初車，乘第二車，至第三車，捨第二車，乘第三車，至第四車，捨第三車，乘第四車，至第五車，捨第四車，乘第五車，至第六車，捨第五車，乘第六車，至第七車，乘第七車，於一日中至婆雞帝。	Having arranged the seven chariots, he set out from Sāvatthī in the first chariot.Riding in the first chariot, he reached the second chariot; leaving behind the first chariot and riding in the second chariot, he reached the third chariot; leaving behind the second chariot and riding in the third chariot, he reached the fourth chariot; leaving behind the third chariot and riding in the fourth chariot, he reached the fifth chariot; leaving behind the fourth chariot and riding in the fifth chariot, he reached the sixth chariot; leaving behind the fifth chariot and riding in the sixth chariot, he reached the seventh chariot; leaving behind the sixth chariot and riding in the seventh chariot, he reached Sāketa within a single day.
彼於婆雞帝辦其事已，大臣圍繞，坐王正殿，群臣白曰：	When the king had dealt with the matter in Sāketa, the great courtiers gathered and surrounded the king, who was seated in the main hall, and respectfully said:
『云何，天王！以一日行從舍衛國至婆雞帝耶？ 』王曰：『如是。』	Great King, did you come in a single day from Sāvatthī to Sāketa? The king replied: That is so. 
『云何天王，乘第一車一日從舍衛國至婆雞帝耶？ 』王曰：『不也。』	Did the Great King come in a single day from Sāvatthī to Sāketa by riding in the first chariot? The king replied: Not so.
『乘第二車乘第三車至第七車，從舍衛國至婆雞帝耶？ 』王曰：『不也。』	Did you come from Sāvatthī to Sāketa by riding in the second chariot… , by riding in the third chariot. , (and so on up to) by riding in the seventh chariot? [And to each question] the king replied: Not so.
云何賢者！拘薩羅王波斯匿群臣復問，當云何說？」	What do you say, venerable friend: in what way should King Pasenadi of Kosala answer on being asked this by the gathering of courtiers?
「王答群臣：『我在舍衛國，於婆雞帝有事，我作是念：「以何方便，令一日行，從舍衛國至婆雞帝耶？」	[Sāriputta answered] The king [should] answer the gathering of courtiers: I was in Sāvatthī and I had some matter [to attend to] in Sāketa. Then I thought, ‘Using what expedient means can I reach Sāketa from Sāvatthī in a single day’s journey?’
我復作是念：「我今寧可從舍衛國至婆雞帝，於其中間布置七車。」	I further thought, ‘I shall now have seven chariots arranged [along the road] from Sāvatthī to Sāketa.’ 
我時即從舍衛國至婆雞帝，於其中間布置七車。	So, I had seven chariots arranged [along the road] from Sāvatthī to Sāketa. 
布七車已，從舍衛國出，至初車，乘初車，至第二車，捨初車，乘第二車，至第三車，捨第二車，乘第三車，至第四車，捨第三車，乘第四車，至第五車，捨第四車，乘第五車，至第六車，捨第五車，乘第六車，至第七車，乘第七車，於一日中至婆雞帝。 』	Having arranged the seven chariots, I set out from Sāvatthī in the first chariot. Riding in the first chariot, I reached the second chariot; leaving behind the first chariot and riding in the second chariot, I reached the third chariot; leaving behind the second chariot and riding in the third chariot, I reached the fourth chariot; leaving behind the third chariot and riding in the fourth chariot, I reached the fifth chariot; leaving behind the fourth chariot and riding in the fifth chariot, I reached the sixth chariot; leaving behind the fifth chariot and riding in the sixth chariot, I reached the seventh chariot; leaving behind the sixth chariot and riding in the seventh chariot, I reached Sāketa within a single day.
如是，賢者！ 拘薩羅王波斯匿答對群臣所問如是。	Thus, venerable friend, [should] King Pasenadi of Kosala reply to the questions put in this way by the gathering of courtiers.
如是，賢者！ 以戒淨故，得心淨，以心淨故，得見淨，以見淨故，得疑蓋淨，以疑葢淨故，得道非道知見淨，以道非道知見淨故，得道跡知見淨，以道跡知見淨故，得道跡斷智淨，以道跡斷智淨故，世尊施設無餘涅槃。」	In the same way, venerable friend, through purification of virtue, one attains purification of mind; through purification of mind, one attains purification of view; through purification of view, one attains purification [from] the hindrance of doubt; through purification [from] the hindrance of doubt, one attains purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path; through purification by knowledge and vision of [what is] the path and [what is] not the path, one attains purification by knowledge and vision of the way; through purification by knowledge and vision of the way, one attains purification by knowledge of the way to abandoning; through purification by knowledge of the way to abandoning, the World-honored One designates nirvana without remainder.
於是，尊者舍梨子問尊者滿慈子：「賢者名何等？諸梵行人云何稱賢者耶？ 」	Then Venerable Sāriputta asked Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta: What is the venerable one’s name? How do his companions in the holy life call the venerable one? 
尊者滿慈子答曰：「賢者！我號滿也。 我母名慈，故諸梵行人稱我為滿慈子。」	Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta replied: Venerable friend, I am called Puṇṇa and my mother’s name is Mantāṇī; therefore, my companions in the holy life call me Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta. 
尊者舍梨子歎曰：「善哉，善哉！賢者滿慈子	Venerable Sāriputta expressed his praise:Excellent, excellent, Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta!
為如來弟子，所作智辯聰明決定，安隱無畏，成就調御，逮大辯才，得甘露幢，於甘露界自作證成就遊，以問賢者甚深義盡能報故。 	As befits a disciple of the Tathāgata, [the venerable one] has explained wisely, with intelligence and determination, calm and without wavering, being an accomplished trainer who has achieved great eloquence, has attained the banner of the deathless, and dwells having himself realized the element of deathlessness—for the venerable one has been able, on being questioned, to respond fully on a profound issue.
賢者滿慈子！諸梵行人為得大利，得值賢者滿慈子，隨時往見，隨時禮拜，我今亦得大利，隨時往見，隨時禮拜。	Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta’s companions in the holy life will obtain great benefit if they get to meet Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta, to visit and pay homage to him on a suitable occasion. Now I too have obtained great benefit on visiting and paying homage to him on [this] suitable occasion.
諸梵行人應當縈衣頂上戴賢者滿慈子，為得大利，我今亦得大利，隨時往見，隨時禮拜。」	Great benefit would be obtained by his companions in the holy life if they were to roll up their robes and put them on their heads to carry Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta [around on their heads]. Now I too have obtained great benefit on visiting and paying homage to him on [this] suitable occasion.
尊者滿慈子問尊者舍梨子：「賢者名何等，諸梵行人云何稱賢者耶？」	Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta asked Venerable Sāriputta: What is the venerable one’s name?
尊者舍梨子答曰：「賢者！我字優波鞮舍，我母名舍梨，故諸梵行人稱我為舍梨子。」	How do his companions in the holy life call the venerable one? Venerable Sāriputta replied: Venerable friend, my name is Upatissa and my mother’s name is Sārī; therefore my companions in the holy life call me Sāriputta.
尊者滿慈子歎曰：「我今與世尊弟子共論而不知，第二尊共論而不知，法將共論而不知，轉法輪復轉弟子共論而不知。	Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta expressed his praise: Today, unwittingly, I have discussed with a disciple of the World-honored One, unwittingly I have discussed with the second most respected one, unwittingly I have discussed with the general of the Dharma, unwittingly I have discussed with the disciple who keeps the wheel of Dharma turning.
若我知尊者舍梨子者，不能答一句，況復爾所深論？	If I had known that this was Venerable Sāriputta, I would not have been able to answer with even one sentence, let alone discuss so deeply.
善哉，善哉！尊者舍梨子！	Excellent, excellent, Venerable Sāriputta!
為如來弟子，所作智辯聰明決定，安隱無畏、成就調御、逮大辯才、得甘露幢，於甘露界自作證成就遊，以尊者甚深甚深問故。 尊者舍梨子！	As befits a disciple of the Tathāgata, [the venerable one] has explained wisely, with intelligence and determination, calm and without wavering, being an accomplished trainer who has achieved great eloquence, has attained the banner of the deathless, and dwells having himself realized the element of deathlessness—for the venerable one has posed very profound questions.
諸梵行人為得大利，得值尊者舍梨子，隨時往見，隨時禮拜，我今亦得大利，隨時往見，隨時禮拜。	Venerable Sāriputta’s companions in the holy life will obtain great benefit if they get to meet Venerable Sāriputta, to visit and pay homage to him on a suitable occasion. Now I too have obtained great benefit on visiting and paying homage to him on this suitable occasion.
諸梵行人應當縈衣頂上戴尊者舍梨子，為得大利，我今亦得大利，隨時往見，隨時禮拜。」	Great benefit would be obtained by his companions in the holy life if they were to roll up their robes and put them on their heads to carry Venerable Sāriputta [around on their heads]. Now I too have obtained great benefit on visiting and paying homage to him on [this] suitable occasion.
如是二賢更相稱說，更相讚善已，歡喜奉行，即從坐起，各還所止。	In this way these two venerable ones praised each other. Having commended each other, they were delighted and remembered [the exchange] well. Each rose from his seat and returned to his dwelling place.

漏盡經	The Discourse on the Cessation of the Taints
我聞如是：一時，佛遊拘樓瘦，在劒磨瑟曇拘樓都邑。	Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was staying among the Kurus, at a Kuru town called Kammāsadhamma.
爾時，世尊告諸比丘：「以知、以見故諸漏得盡，非不知、非不見也。	At that time, the World-honored One addressed the monks: Through knowing and seeing, one attains the cessation of the taints, not without knowing and seeing.
云何以知、以見故諸漏得盡耶？	How does one attain the cessation of the taints through knowing and seeing?
有正思惟、不正思惟，若不正思惟者，未生欲漏而生，已生便增廣，未生有漏、無明漏而生，已生便增廣；	There is right attention and there is wrong attention. If one engages in wrong attention, then the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will arise and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will increase; the not yet arisen taints of existence and of ignorance will arise and the arisen [taints of existence and of ignorance] will increase.
若正思惟者，未生欲漏而不生，已生便滅，未生有漏、無明漏而不生，已生便滅。	If, [however,] one engages in right attention, then the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will not arise and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will cease; the not yet arisen taints of existence and of ignorance will not arise and the arisen [taints of existence and of ignorance] will cease.
然凡夫愚人不得聞正法，不值真知識，不知聖法，不調御聖法，不知如真法。 不正思惟者，未生欲漏而生，已生便增廣，未生有漏、無明漏而生，已生便增廣。	The foolish worldling, who has not got to hear the right Dharma, has not met genuine good friends, does not know the noble Dharma, has not been trained in the noble Dharma, and does not know the Dharma as it really is—[if such a person] engages in wrong attention, then the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will arise, and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will increase; the not yet arisen taints of existence and of ignorance will arise, and the arisen [taints of existence and of ignorance] will increase.
正思惟者，未生欲漏而不生，已生便滅，未生有漏、無明漏而不生，已生便滅。	[If, however, this person] engages in right attention, then the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will not arise, and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will cease; the not yet arisen taints of existence and of ignorance will not arise, and the arisen [taints of existence and of ignorance] will cease.
不知如真法故，不應念法而念，應念法而不念，以不應念法而念，應念法而不念故，未生欲漏而生，已生便增廣，未生有漏、無明漏而生，已生便增廣。	Through not knowing the Dharma as it really is, [the foolish worldling] thinks thoughts that should not be thought, and does not think thoughts that should be thought. Through his thinking thoughts that should not be thought, and not thinking thoughts that should be thought, the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will arise, and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will increase; the not yet arisen taints of existence and of ignorance will arise, and the arisen [taints of existence and of ignorance] will increase.
多聞聖弟子得聞正法，值真知識，調御聖法，知如真法。 不正思惟者，未生欲漏而生，已生便增廣，未生有漏、無明漏而生，已生便增廣。	The learned noble disciple who has got to hear the right Dharma, has met genuine good friends, has been trained in the noble Dharma, and knows the Dharma as it really is—[if such a person nevertheless] engages in wrong attention, then the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will arise, and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will increase; the not yet arisen taints of existence and of ignorance will arise, and the arisen [taints of existence and of ignorance] will increase.
正思惟者，未生欲漏而不生，已生便滅，未生有漏、無明漏而不生，已生便滅。	[If, however, such a person] engages in right attention, then the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will not arise, and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will cease; the not yet arisen taints of existence and of ignorance will not arise, and the arisen [taints of existence and of ignorance] will cease.
知如真法已，不應念法不念，應念法便念，以不應念法不念，應念法便念故，未生欲漏而不生，已生便滅，未生有漏、無明漏而不生，已生便滅也。	Through knowing the Dharma as it really is, [the learned noble disciple] does not think thoughts that should not be thought, and thinks thoughts that should be thought. Through his not thinking thoughts that should not be thought, and thinking thoughts that should be thought, the not yet arisen taint of sensual desire will not arise, and the arisen [taint of sensual desire] will cease; the not yet arisen taints of existence and of ignorance will not arise, and the arisen [taints of existence and of ignorance] will cease.
有七斷漏、煩惱、憂慼法。云何為七？	There are seven [ways] of abandoning the taints, which [cause] distress, vexation, dejection, and sorrow. What are the seven?
有漏從見斷，有漏從護斷，有漏從離斷，有漏從用斷，有漏從忍斷，有漏從除斷，有漏從思斷。	There are taints that are to be abandoned through seeing, there are taints to be abandoned through guarding, there are taints to be abandoned through a avoiding, there are taints to be abandoned through using, there are taints to be abandoned through enduring, there are taints to be abandoned through removing, and there are taints to be abandoned through attending.
云何有漏從見斷耶？	How are taints abandoned through seeing?
凡夫愚人不得聞正法，不值真知識，不知聖法，不調御聖法，不知如真法，不正思惟故，便作是念：『我有過去世，我無過去世，我何因過去世，我云何過去世耶？	The foolish worldling, who has not got to hear the right Dharma, has not met genuine good friends, does not know the noble Dharma, and has not been trained in the noble Dharma—he does not know the Dharma as it really is. [Such a person,] through not practicing right attention, has the following thoughts: I was in the past! I was not in the past! From what cause was I in the past? How was I in the past?
我有未來世，我無未來世，我何因未來世，我云何未來世耶？	I will be in the future! I will not be in the future! From what cause will I be in the future? How will I be in the future?
自疑己身何謂是，云何是耶？	He wonders about himself [in the present]: What is this so-called self? How did it come to be?
今此眾生從何所來，當至何所？	This present sentient being, from where has it come? Where will it go?
本何因有，當何因有？』	Rooted in what cause does it exist? From what future cause will it exist?
彼作如是不正思惟，於六見中隨其見生而生真有神，此見生而生真無神，此見生而生神見神，此見生而生神見非神，此見生而生非神見神，此見生而生此是神，能語、能知、能作、教、作起、教起，生彼彼處，受善惡報，定無所從來，定不有、定不當有。	As he engages in wrong attention in this way, there arises [one or another of] six views. The view arises that there truly is a self; or the view arises that there truly is no self; or the view arises that the self perceives the self; or the view arises that the self perceives the not-self; or the view arises that the not-self perceives the self; or the view arises that this is the self, namely that which is able to talk, able to know, able to act and to teach, and which acts and teaches, which is born in this or that realm and experiences the fruits of good and evil [actions], which certainly has come from nowhere, certainly does not exist, and certainly will not exist.
是謂見之弊，為見所動，見結所繫，凡夫愚人以是之故，便受生、老、病、死苦也。	This is called the deception of views, the agitation of views, the bondage of views, because of which the foolish worldling undergoes the suffering of birth, old age, disease, and death.
多聞聖弟子得聞正法，值真知識，調御聖法，知如真法，知苦如真，知苦習、知苦滅、知苦滅道如真。	The learned noble disciple, who has got to hear the right Dharma, has met genuine good friends, and has been trained in the noble Dharma—he knows the Dharma as it really is, knows suffering as it really is, knows the arising of suffering, knows the cessation of suffering, and knows the path [leading] to the cessation of suffering as it really is. 
彼如是知、如是見，三結便盡，謂身見、戒取、疑。	Through his having come to know this as it really is, three fetters cease: personality view, clinging to precepts, and doubt.
