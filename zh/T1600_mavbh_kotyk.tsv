辯相品第一	Part I Chapter One Definition of Characteristics
稽首造此論，   善逝體所生	Reverence to the author of this treatise, born of the body of the Sugata, 
及教我等師，   當勤顯斯義	and to the master who teaches us, for I shall diligently explicate its meaning.
此中最初安立論體。	Here at the beginning I will set forth the structure of the treatise.
頌曰：   唯相障真實，   及修諸對治，   即此修分位，   得果無上乘。	The verse reads as follows: (1) Characteristics, (2) Obstacles, (3) Reality, (4) Cultivation of Antidotes, (5) Stages of the Practices, (6) Attainments, and (7) Unexcelled Vehicle (i.e., Mahayana). 
論曰：此論唯說如是七義，一相、二障、三真實、四修諸對治、五即此修分位、六得果、七無上乘。	Commentary: This treatise addresses these seven topics: (1) characteristics, (2) obstacles, (3) reality, (4) cultivation of antidotes, (5) the stages of practice, (6) the results obtained, (7) the Unexcelled Vehicle.
今於此中先辯其相。	Here we will first analyze the characteristics.
頌曰：   虛妄分別有，   於此二都無，   此中唯有空，   於彼亦有此。	The verse reads as follows: There is false discrimination, yet here these two do not exist. Herein there is but emptiness, and that is also existent in this.
論曰：虛妄分別有者，謂有所取、能取分別。	Commentary: “There is false discrimination” refers to there being discrimination between the grasped and the grasper (i.e., the conceptually apprehending subject and object).
於此二都無者，謂即於此虛妄分別，永無所取、能取二性。	“Yet here these two do not exist” means that here false discrimination is never of the duality of grasped and grasper.
此中唯有空者，謂虛妄分別中但有離所取及能取空性。	“Herein there is but emptiness” means that within false discrimination, there is only emptiness that is devoid of grasped and grasper.
於彼亦有此者，謂即於彼二空性中亦但有此虛妄分別。	“And that is also existent in this” means that therein within the emptiness of the two there is also only this false discrimination.
若於此非有，由彼觀為空； 所餘非無故，如實知為有。	If here there are no [grasped and grasper], it is due to those [two] being observed as empty; one understands [phenomena] as they actually are, since what remains is not nonexistent.
若如是者，則能無倒顯示空相。	This being so, the characteristic of emptiness can then be revealed without cognitive distortion.
復次頌曰：   故說一切法，   非空非不空，   有無及有故，   是則契中道。	The verse reads as follows: Thus, it is taught that all phenomena are neither empty nor non-empty. This is due to existence, nonexistence, and again existence. This then accords with the Middle Way.
論曰：一切法者，謂諸有為及無為法。	Commentary: “All phenomena” refers to conditioned and unconditioned phenomena.
虛妄分別名有為，二取空性名無為。	False discriminations are said to be conditioned. The emptiness of the two forms of grasping is called unconditioned.
依前理故，說此一切法非空非不空，由有空性虛妄分別故說非空，由無所取能取性故說非不空。	According to the former line of reasoning, it is said here that all phenomena are neither empty nor non-empty. Due to the existence of false discrimination [in] emptiness, they are said to be non-empty. Due to the nonexistence of grasped and grasper they are said to be not non-empty. 
有故者，謂有空性虛妄分別故。	“Due to existence” means “due to the existence of false discrimination [in] emptiness.”
無故者，謂無所取能取二性故。	“Due to nonexistence” means “due to there being no duality of that which is grasped and the grasper.” 
及有故者，謂虛妄分別中有空性故，及空性中有虛妄分別故。	“Due to and again existence” means “due to the fact that within false discrimination there is emptiness” and “due to that within emptiness there is false discrimination.” “This accords with the Middle Way” means that all phenomena are not exclusively empty, nor are they exclusively non-empty. This line of reasoning marvelously accords with the Middle Way.
是則契中道者，謂一切法非一向空亦非一向不空，如是理趣妙契中道，亦善符順般若等經說一切法非空非有。	It also conforms well to the sutras, such as those of the Prajñāpāramitā, which state that all phenomena are neither empty nor existent.
如是已顯虛妄分別有相無相，此自相今當說。	Having thus explained the characteristic of existence and the characteristic of nonexistence in relation to false discrimination, I will now explain the intrinsic characteristic. The verse reads as follows:
頌曰：   識生變似義、   有情、我及了，   此境實非有，   境無故識無。	Consciousness produces the appearances of (1) objects, (2) sentient beings, (3) self, and (4) cognitions. These objects are actually nonexistent. Since objects are nonexistent, there is no consciousness.5 Commentary:
論曰：變似義者，謂似色等諸境性現。	“The appearance of objects” means the appearance of the qualities of objects such as form and so forth.
變似有情者，謂似自他身五根性現。	“The appearance of sentient beings” means the appearance of qualities of the five faculties of the body of oneself and others.
變似我者，謂染末那與我癡等恒相應故。	“The appearance of self” means the afflicted manas (mind) because it is always concomitant with delusion in regard to the self and so forth.
變似了者，謂餘六識，了相麁故。 此境實非有者，謂似義似根無行相故，似我似了非真現故，皆非實有。	“The appearance of cognitions” means the other six consciousnesses (visual, auditory, etc.), because the characteristics of the cognitions are coarse.6 “These objects are actually nonexistent” means that there is no mode of appearance with respect to objects and faculties in appearance. Since Chapter One the appearances of self and cognitions are unreal appearances, all the aforementioned things are not actually existent.
境無故識無者，謂所取義等四境無故，能取諸識亦非實有。	“Since objects are nonexistent, there is no consciousness” means that since the four aforementioned grasped objects are not existent, the consciousnesses that grasp them are also not actually existent. The verse reads as follows:
復次頌曰：   虛妄分別性，   由此義得成，   非實有全無，   許滅解脫故。	The nature of false discrimination is obtained based upon this meaning: it is neither actually existent nor entirely nonexistent. Liberation is thus considered to be the cessation [of false discrimination].
論曰：虛妄分別由此義故成非實有，如所現起非真有故；	Commentary: “False discrimination” is thus defined based on this meaning: it is established that it is not actually existent, since it is like something manifested, which is not actually existent.
亦非全無，於中少有亂識生故。	It is also not entirely nonexistent, since herein there is at least the arising of disturbed consciousness.
如何不許此性全無？	Why is this nature not admitted to be entirely nonexistent?
以許此滅得解脫故。	Because we accept that liberation is attained from the cessation of this [false discrimination].
若異此者，繫縛解脫則應皆無，如是便成撥無雜染及清淨失。	If it were otherwise, then bondage and liberation should not exist, and, in this manner, it would constitute the fault of denying defilements and purification.
已顯虛妄分別自相，此攝相今當說。	Having explained the intrinsic characteristic of false discrimination, here the collective characteristic will be explained.
但有如是虛妄分別，即能具攝三種自性。	It is only this false discrimination that fully comprises three types of intrinsic natures.
頌曰：   唯所執、依他，   及圓成實性，   境故分別故，   及二空故說。	The verse reads as follows: The natures of the conceptualized, the other-dependent, and the perfectly accomplished are explained on account of object, discrimination, and the emptiness of the two.
論曰：依止虛妄分別境故，說有遍計所執自性。	Commentary: The existence of the nature of the conceptualized is explained based on falsely discriminated objects.
依止虛妄分別性故，說有依他起自性。	The existence of the nature of the other-dependent is explained based on the nature of false discrimination.
依止所取能取空故，說有圓成實自性。	The existence of the nature of the perfectly accomplished is explained based on the emptiness of the grasped and the grasper.
已顯虛妄分別攝相，當說即於虛妄分別入無相方便相。 頌曰：   依識有所得，   境無所得生；	Having explained the collective characteristic of false discrimination, I will explain the characteristic of the means by which one comprehends the characteristic of nonexistence in relation to false discrimination.7 The verse reads as follows:
依境無所得，   識無所得生。	Due to perception of consciousness, nonperception of objects arises; due to nonperception of objects, nonperception of consciousness arises. Commentary:
論曰：依止唯識有所得故，先有於境無所得生；	On the basis of perception of consciousness only (vijñaptimātra), first there arises nonperception of objects.
復依於境無所得故，後有於識無所得生。	Moreover, due to nonperception of objects, there subsequently arises nonperception of consciousness.
由是方便，得入所取能取無相。	It is through these means that one comprehends the characteristic of the nonexistence of grasped and grasper.8 Next, the verse reads as follows: Due to the nature of perception of consciousness, [the nature of] nonperception [of consciousness] is also established.
復次頌曰：   由識有得性，   亦成無所得，   故知二有得，   無得性平等。	It is thus known that both perception and nonperception are equivalent in nature.
論曰：唯識生時現似種種虛妄境故，名有所得。	Commentary: Perception is so called because when consciousness only occurs, there appear to exist various types of falsely discriminated objects.
以所得境無實性故，能得實性亦不得成。	Since the perceived objects are unreal, it is also not possible to perceive any reality to them.
由能得識無所得故，所取能取二有所得，平等俱成無所得性。	Having realized nonperception of consciousness, both grasped and grasper, [although] perceptible, are together realized as equally inapprehensible.
顯入虛妄分別無相方便相已，此差別異門相今次當說。	Having explained the characteristic of the means by which one comprehends the characteristic of nonexistence in relation to false discrimination, I will now explain the characteristics of the distinctions and synonyms.
頌曰。	The verse reads as follows:
三界心心所，   是虛妄分別，   唯了境名心，   亦別名心所。	The mind and mental factors of the three realms are false discriminations. Mere cognition of objects is called mind, and distinctions are called mental factors.
論曰：虛妄分別差別相者，即是欲界色無色界諸心心所。	Commentary: The characteristics of distinction related to false discrimination are the minds and mental factors of the desire realm, the form realms, and the formless realms.
異門相者，唯能了境總相名心，亦了差別名為受等諸心所法。	As to the characteristics of synonyms [related to false discrimination], the mere cognition of the general characteristic of objects is called mind. Also, cognitions of distinctions are called the mental factors, such as feeling, etc.
今次當說此生起相。	From here I will explain the characteristic of the arising [of false discrimination]. The verse reads as follows: The first is called conditioning consciousness.
頌曰：   一則名緣識，   第二名受者，   此中能受用，   分別推心所。	The second is called the experiencer. Herein are the mental factors of (1) experience, (2) discrimination, and (3) stimulation. Chapter One Commentary:
論曰：緣識者，謂藏識，是餘識生緣故。	The conditioning consciousness is the store consciousness, since this is the condition for the arising of other consciousnesses.
藏識為緣所生轉識，受用主故名為受者。	The store consciousness functions as the condition for the forthcoming consciousnesses that arise. The subject of experience is called the experiencer.
此諸識中受能受用、想能分別、思作意等諸相應行能推諸識，此三助心故名心所。	Among these consciousnesses, feeling functions to experience, and perception functions to discriminate. Volition, attention, and so forth are concomitant formations, functioning to stimulate [the other] consciousnesses. These three auxiliary mental states are therefore called mental factors.
今次當說此雜染相。	Next, I will explain the characteristics of defilements. The verses read as follows:
頌曰：   覆障及安立、   將導、攝、圓滿、   三分別、受用、   引起并連縛、   現前、苦果故，   唯此惱世間，   三、二、七雜染，   由虛妄分別。	(1) Concealing and obstruction, (2) establishing, (3) leading, (4) collecting, (5) completing, (6) threefold discrimination, (7) experiencing, (8) inducing, (9) fettering, (10) manifesting, and (11) the fruit of suffering. The world is defiled due to these. The three, two, and seven defilements result from false discrimination.
論曰：覆障故者，謂由無明覆如實理、障真見故。	Commentary: “Due to concealing and obstruction” means that ignorance obscures reality and obstructs accurate vision.
安立故者，謂由諸行植本識中，業熏習故。	“Due to establishing” means that mental formations deposit karmic perfuming in the base consciousness (i.e., the store consciousness).
將導故者，謂有取識引諸有情至生處故。	“Due to leading” means that consciousness, having attachment, directs sentient beings into a place of birth.
攝故者，謂名色攝有情自體故。	“Due to collecting” means that name and form gather sentient beings into individual existences.
圓滿故者，謂六內處令諸有情體具足故。	“Due to completing” means that the six internal sense bases form sentient beings into a complete body.
三分別故者，謂觸能分別根境識三，順三受故。	“Due to threefold discrimination” means contact can discriminate the three agreeable sensations and three feelings [of pleasure, pain, and neither pleasure nor pain] of faculty, object, and consciousness.
受用故者，謂由受支領納順違，非二境故。	“Due to experience” refers to objects related to sensory experience of what is agreeable, disagreeable, or neither.
引起故者，謂由愛力令先業所引後有得起故。	“Due to inducing” means that the power of craving brings about the arising of a future existence induced by past karma.
連縛故者，謂取令識緣順欲等連縛生故。	“Due to fettering” refers to grasping, which causes fetters to arise, in which consciousness is made to conform to desire and so forth.
現前故者，謂由有力令已作業所與後有諸異熟果得現前故。	“Due to manifesting” refers to the force of previous existences causing the appearance of various matured karmic fruits in a future existence based upon past activities.
苦果故者，謂生老死性有逼迫，酬前因故。	“Due to the fruit of suffering” means that the natures of birth, aging, and death are impelled as retribution from past causes.
唯此所說十二有支，逼惱世間令不安隱。	The twelve links of dependent origination explained here disturb people and make them uncomfortable.
三雜染者，一煩惱雜染，謂無明愛取； 二業雜染，謂行有； 三生雜染，謂餘支。	The three defilements: (1) the defilements of afflictions, which refer to ignorance, craving, and grasping; (2) the defilements of karma, which refer to mental formations and becoming; (3) the defilements of birth, which refer to the other links of dependent origination.
二雜染者，一因雜染、謂煩惱業； 二果雜染、謂所餘支。	The two defilements: (1) defilements as cause, which refer to afflicted karma; (2) defilements as results, which refer to the remaining links of dependent origination.
七雜染者，謂七種因：一顛倒因，謂無明； 二牽引因，謂行； 三將導因，謂識； 四攝受因，謂名色、六處；	The seven defilements refer to seven types of causes:
五受用因，謂觸、受； 六引起因，謂愛、取、有； 七厭怖因，謂生、老死。	(1) the cause of cognitive distortion, which refers to ignorance [among the twelve links of dependent origination]; (2) inducing causes, which refer to mental formations; (3) leading causes, which refer to consciousness; (4) gathering causes, which refer to name, form, and the six sense bases; (5) experiential causes, which refer to contact and feeling; (6) inductive causes, which refer to craving, grasping, and becoming; (7) distressing causes, which refer to birth, aging, and death.
此諸雜染無不皆由虛妄分別而得生長。 此前總顯虛妄分別有九種相：一有相、二無相、三自相、四攝相、五入無相方便相、六差別相、七異門相、八生起相、九雜染相。	These defilements all grow from false discrimination. Here I summarize the nine characteristics of false discrimination elucidated earlier: (1) the characteristic of existence, (2) the characteristic of nonexistence, (3) the characteristic of intrinsic characteristic, (4) the characteristic of collection, (5) the characteristic of the means by which one comprehends the characteristic of nonexistence [in relation to false discrimination], (6) the characteristic of distinction, (7) the characteristic of synonym, (8) the characteristic of arising, (9) the characteristic of defilement.
如是已顯虛妄分別，今次當說所知空性。	Having thus explained false discrimination, I will now explain the emptiness that is known.
頌曰：   諸相及異門，   義差別成立，   應知二空性，   略說唯由此。	The verse reads as follows: The emptiness of the two should be understood via (1) characteristics, (2) synonyms, (3) meanings, (4) distinctions, and (5) their proofs. The brief explanation is derived from these.
論曰：應知所取能取空性，略說但由此相等五。	Commentary: The emptiness of grasped and grasper should be understood. The brief explanation is derived from these five (characteristics, etc.).
所知空性其相云何？	What are the characteristics of emptiness to be understood? The verse reads as follows:
頌曰：   無二有無故，   非有亦非無，   非異亦非一，   是說為空相。	Chapter One It is by way of nonduality and existence of nonexistence that [we speak of] not-existence as well as not-nonexistence. They are neither different nor identical. This is explained as the characteristic of emptiness. Commentary:
論曰：無二，謂無所取能取。	“Nonduality” refers to the absence of grasped and grasper.
有無，謂有二取之無。	“Existence of nonexistence” refers to there being the nonexistence of the two types of grasping.
此即顯空無性為性，故此空相非有非無。	This explains how emptiness has nonexistence (abhāva) for its nature. Hence, this characteristic of emptiness is neither existence nor nonexistence.
云何非有？	What is meant by “not-existence”?
無二有故。	It is the absence of the two types of existence [of grasped and grasper].
云何非無？	What is meant by “not-nonexistent”?
有二無故。 此顯空相非有非無。	It is that there are the two kinds of nonexistents, [the lack of self in persons and in phenomena].9 This explains the characteristic of emptiness, i.e., neither existence nor nonexistence.
此空與彼虛妄分別非異非一，若異應成法性異法。 便違正理，如苦等性；	This emptiness and that false discrimination are neither different from one another nor identical. If they were different, then it would mean that the nature of a dharma would differ from dharmas, which would be illogical, such as in the case of the nature of suffering and so forth.
若一則應非淨智境亦非共相。	If identical, then it should stand that it [emptiness] is not an object of pure cognition, nor would it be of common characteristic [with phenomena].
此即顯空與妄分別離一異相。	This explains that emptiness and false discrimination are removed from the characteristics of sameness and difference.
所知空性異門云何？	What are the synonyms of emptiness?
頌曰：   略說空異門，   謂真如、實際、   無相、勝義性、   法界等應知。	The verse reads as follows: I will briefly explain the synonyms of emptiness: they should be understood as referring to (1) thusness, (2) the apex of reality, (3) the signless (animitta), (4) the nature of ultimate reality, and (5) experiential reality (dharma dhātu). Commentary:
論曰：略說空性，有此異門。	The brief explanation of emptiness includes these synonyms.
云何應知此異門義？	What are the meanings of the synonyms?
頌曰：   由無變無倒，   相滅聖智境，   及諸聖法因，   異門義如次。	The verse reads as follows: The meanings of the synonyms are in the following order: (1) immutability, (2) the absence of cognitive distortion, (3) cessation of signs, (4) the sphere of noble wisdom, and (5) the cause of the noble dharmas.
論曰：即此中說所知空性，由無變義說為真如。 真性常如，無轉易故。	Commentary: Here emptiness, which is to be understood, is explained. The meaning of “immutability” explains thusness, since reality is constant, not being transitory.
由無倒義說為實際，非諸顛倒，依緣事故。	The meaning of “the absence of cognitive distortion” explains the apex of reality, since there is no basis for cognitive distortions.
由相滅義說為無相，此中永絕一切相故。	The meaning of “the cessation of signs” explains the absence of signs, since here all signs are permanently eliminated.
由聖智境義說為勝義性，是最勝智所行義故。	The meaning of “the sphere of noble wisdom” explains the supreme meaning, since this is the meaning of the sphere of supreme wisdom.
由聖法因義說為法界，以一切聖法緣此生故。	The meaning of “the cause of the noble dharmas” explains experiential reality (dharmadhātu), since all noble dharmas are produced dependent upon this.
此中界者，即是因義。 無我等義如理應知。	Here dhātu refers to the meaning of cause and meanings of not-self, etc., and should be understood according to reason.
云何應知空性差別？	How are we to understand the distinctions in emptiness?
頌曰：   此雜染、清淨，   由有垢、無垢，   如水界全空，   淨故許為淨。	The verse reads as follows: These defilements and purity stem from the presence or absence of taint. Purity is considered pure like the element of water, gold, or space.10 Commentary:
論曰：空性差別略有二種，一雜染、二清淨。	The distinctions in emptiness are of two main types: the first is defiled, the second is pure.
此成染淨由分位別，謂有垢位說為雜染，出離垢時說為清淨。	These constitute defilement and purity. They are distinguished according to the state, which means that the presence of taint is explained as defiled, while it is explained as purity when there is separation from taint.
雖先雜染、後成清淨，而非轉變成無常失。	Although it is first defiled and then becomes pure, it is not that [the nature of emptiness] has transformed, since this would constitute an error with respect to impermanence.
如水界等出離客塵，空淨亦然，非性轉變。	Just as the elements of water and so forth are [essentially] free from contaminants, so too is the purity of space. It is not the case that it is transformed in nature.
此空差別復有十六，謂內空、外空、內外空、大空、空空、勝義空、有為空、無為空、畢竟空、無際空、無散空、本性空、相空、一切法空、無性空、無性自性空。	There are furthermore sixteen kinds of emptiness: (1) inner emptiness, (2) outer emptiness, (3) the emptiness of inner and outer, (4) great emptiness, (5) the emptiness of emptiness, (6) the emptiness of the supreme meaning, (7) conditioned emptiness, (8) unconditioned emptiness, (9) ultimate emptiness, (10) boundless emptiness, (11) the emptiness of nondispersal, (12) the emptiness of original nature, (13) the emptiness of characteristics (lakṣaṇa), (14) the emptiness of all qualities, (15) the emptiness of nonexistence, and (16) the emptiness of the intrinsic nature of nonexistence.
此等略義云何應知？	How should these brief meanings be understood?
頌曰：   能食及所食，   此依身所住，   能見此如理，   所求二淨空。	The verses read as follows: The (1) eater and the (2) eaten (i.e., the experiencing subject and the object of experience), (3) the bodies upon which these are dependent, and (4) the abode.
為常益有情、   為不捨生死、   為善無窮盡，   故觀此為空。	Perceive these according to reason, the emptiness of the two Chapter One kinds of purities that are sought for the constant benefit to beings, so as to not abandon samsara, and so as to be skillfully inexhaustible.
為種性清淨、   為得諸相好、   為淨諸佛法，   故菩薩觀空。	Thus contemplate these as empty, for the purity of the spiritual lineage, for the attainment of the primary and secondary marks, and for the pure Dharma of the buddhas. Thus the bodhisattva contemplates emptiness.
論曰：能食空者，依內處說，即是內空。	Commentary: The emptiness of the eater is explained based on the inner sense bases, which refers to (1) inner emptiness.
所食空者，依外處說，即是外空。	The emptiness of the eaten is explained based on external bases, which refers to (2) outer emptiness.
此依身者，謂能所食所依止身，此身空故，名內外空。	“The body upon which these are dependent” refers to the body upon which the eater and the eaten are dependent. This body is empty, hence it is called (3) the emptiness of inner and outer.
諸器世間說為所住，此相寬廣故名為大，所住空故名為大空。	The receptacle world is called an abode. It is called great due to its vastness. Since the abode is empty, it is called (4) great emptiness.
能見此者，謂智能見內處等空。	“Perceive these” refers to perceiving through knowledge the emptiness of the inner sense bases, etc.
空智空故，說名空空。	The wisdom of emptiness is empty, hence it is called (5) the emptiness of emptiness.
如理者，謂勝義，即如實行。	“According to reason” refers to the supreme meaning, which is the accurate practice of the contemplated reality.
所觀真理，此即空故，名勝義空。	This is empty, hence it is called (6) the emptiness of the supreme meaning.
菩薩修行為得二淨，即諸有為、無為善法。	The bodhisattva practices to attain the two kinds of purity, which refer to conditioned and unconditioned wholesome phenomena.
此二空故，名有為空及無為空。	These two types of emptiness are therefore called (7) conditioned emptiness and (8) unconditioned emptiness.
為於有情常作饒益，而觀空故，名畢竟空。	They constantly benefit sentient beings while contemplating emptiness, hence it is called (9) ultimate emptiness. Samsara is eternal with neither beginning nor end.
生死長遠無初後際，觀此空故，名無際空。	Contemplating this as empty, it is therefore called (10) boundless emptiness.
不觀為空便速厭捨，為不厭捨此生死故，觀此無際生死為空。	To not contemplate this as empty would quickly lead to disillusionment. [The bodhisattvas] contemplate this boundless samsara as empty in order to not become disillusioned with samsara.
為所修善至無餘依般涅槃位，亦無散捨而觀空故，名無散空。	The virtue cultivated while contemplating emptiness is not abandoned up to the state of parinirvāṇa without reminder.
諸聖種姓自體本有，非習所成，說名本性。	This is therefore called (11) the emptiness of nondispersal.11 The spiritual lineages of the nobles are inherent, and are not formed through habituation, hence it is said to be their original nature.
菩薩為此速得清淨而觀空故，名本性空。	The bodhisattva quickly attains purity due to this while contemplating emptiness, hence it is called (12) the emptiness of original nature.
菩薩為得大士相好而觀空故，名為相空。	The bodhisattva attains the primary and secondary characteristics of a great person while contemplating emptiness, hence it is called (13) the emptiness of characteristics.
菩薩為令力無畏等一切佛法皆得清淨而觀此空，故名一切法空。 是十四空，隨別安立。	The bodhisattva attains purity in regard to all the qualities of the Buddha, such as powers and fearlessness, etc., while contemplating this emptiness, hence it is called (14) the emptiness of all qualities. [Up to here] these fourteen types of emptiness have been set forth individually.
此中何者說名為空？	What is here called emptiness? The verse reads as follows: Person and phenomena:
頌曰：   補特伽羅法，   實性俱非有，   此無性、有性，   故別立二空。	their real natures are both not-existent. Hence, the emptiness of the two is separately established here in relation to nonexistence and existence. Commentary:
論曰：補特伽羅及法實性俱非有故，名無性空。	Since the real natures of neither persons (pudgala) nor phenomena exist, [this instance] is called (15) the emptiness of nonexistence.
此無性空非無自性，空以無性為自性故，名無性自性空。	This emptiness of nonexistence is not the intrinsic nature of nonexistence.
於前所說能食空等，為顯空相別立二空；	The (16) emptiness of the intrinsic nature of nonexistence is called as such because the intrinsic nature of emptiness is considered to be nonexistence.12 As explained earlier, in the case of the emptiness of the eater and so forth, the emptiness of the two is separately established to elucidate the characteristics of emptiness.
此為遮止補特伽羅法增益執、空損減執，如其次第立後二空。	This serves to restrain attachment to reification of person and phenomena, as well as attachment to negation by emptiness. The emptiness of the two is established according to this order.
如是已顯空性差別。 此成立義云何應知？	Having explained the distinctions in emptiness, how should the meaning proven here be understood?
頌曰：   此若無雜染，   一切應自脫；	The verse reads as follows: Here if there were no defilements, all would be naturally liberated.
此若無清淨，   功用應無果。	Here if there were no purity, effort would be fruitless.
論曰：若諸法空，未生對治無客雜染者，一切有情不由功用應自然解脫。	Commentary: If phenomena were empty, and prior to the production of an antidote there were no adventitious defilements, then all beings would naturally be liberated without effort.
若對治已生亦不清淨，則應求解脫勤勞無果。	If the antidotes had already been produced and yet there was still impurity, then there would be no fruit when striving in pursuit of liberation.
既爾，頌曰：   非染非不染，   非淨非不淨，   心性本淨故，   由客塵所染。	The verse reads as follows: Neither defiled nor undefiled; neither pure nor impure; since the nature of the mind is originally pure, it is defiled by adventitious defilements.
論曰：云何非染非不染？	Commentary: Why neither defiled nor undefiled?
以心性本淨故。 云何非淨非不淨？	It is because the nature of the mind is originally pure. Why neither pure nor impure?
由客塵所染故。	It is because Chapter One [the nature of mind] is defiled as a result of adventitious defilements.
是名成立空差別義。	This is called proving the meanings of the distinctions of emptiness.
此前空義總有二種，謂相安立。	This previous meaning of emptiness generally includes two types, which refer to characteristics and establishment.
相復有二，謂無及有。	The characteristics further include two types, namely nonexistence and existence.
空性有相，離有離無、離異離一以為其相。	The characteristic of emptiness in relation to existence is being apart from existence, nonexistence, difference, and sameness, which is considered its characteristic.
應知安立即異門等。	One should understand that the establishment is in terms of synonyms and so forth.
辯障品第二已辯其相，障今當說。	Chapter Two Discussion of Obstacles Having analyzed characteristics [the terminology outlined above], I will now explain the obstacles. The verse reads as follows:
頌曰：   具分及一分，   增盛與平等，   於生死取捨，   說障二種性。	The whole and the partial, the excessive and regular, and the grasping and rejection of samsara, are explained as obstacles related to [practitioners of the] two spiritual lineages (gotra).
論曰：具分障者，謂煩惱障及所知障，於諸菩薩種性法中具為障故。	Commentary: The “whole” obstacles refer to afflictive obstacles and cognitive obstacles, since they constitute obstacles within the spiritual lineage of bodhisattvas.
一分障者，謂煩惱障，障聲聞等種性法故。 增盛障者，謂即彼貪等行。	The “partial” obstacles refer to afflictive obstacles, since they obstruct the ways of the spiritual lineages of the śrāvakas, etc.13 The “excessive” obstacle affects those who experience craving, etc.
平等障者，謂即彼等分行。	The “regular” obstacle affects those who act in a normal manner (i.e., those with few defilements).
取捨生死，能障菩薩種性所得無住涅槃，名於生死有取捨障。 如是五障隨其所應，說障菩薩及聲聞等二種種性。	“Grasping and rejection of samsara” refer to obstruction of the attainment of the nirvana of nonabiding by the bodhisattva spiritual lineage, called “the obstacle of grasping and rejection of samsara.” The five obstacles are accordingly like this, explaining the obstructions to the two types of spiritual lineages (bodhisattvas and śrāvakas, etc.). The verses read as follows:
復次頌曰：   九種煩惱相，   謂愛等九結，   初二障厭捨，   餘七障真見，   謂能障身見，   彼事滅道寶，   利養恭敬等，   遠離遍知故。	The nine types of characteristics of afflictions refer to the nine fetters of craving, etc. The first two obstruct disillusionment and dispassion. The other seven obstruct accurate vision, referring to the obstruction of full comprehension of (1) the false view of individuated identity, (2) its things, (3) cessation, (4) the path, (5) the Three Treasures, (6) gain and honor, and (7) detachment.
論曰：煩惱障相略有九種，謂愛等九種結。	Commentary: There are, briefly speaking, nine types of characteristics of obstacles in relation to afflictions, referring to the nine types of fetters, which include craving, etc.
愛結障厭，由此於順境不能厭離故。	(1) The fetter of craving obstructs disillusionment because one is unable to distance oneself from favorable objects of cognition.
恚結障捨，由此於違境不能棄捨故。	(2) The fetter of hatred obstructs dispassion because one is unable to relinquish unfavorable objects of perception.
餘七結障真見，於七遍知如次障故。	The other seven fetters obstruct accurate vision. Full comprehension is obstructed in the following seven ways. (3) The fetter of conceit obstructs full comprehension of the falsity of the view of individuated existence.
謂慢結能障偽身見遍知，修現觀時有間無間我慢現起，由此勢力彼不斷故。 無明結能障身見事遍知，由此不知諸取蘊故。	Due to the momentum of intermittent and continuous arising of self-conceit, this fetter is not severed during cultivation of present contemplation.14 (4) The fetter of ignorance obstructs full comprehension of the view of individuated existence, because one does not realize that [the sentient being is comprised of] appropriated aggregates.
見結能障滅諦遍知，由薩迦耶及邊執見怖畏滅故，由邪見謗滅故。	(5) The fetter of views obstructs full comprehension of the noble truth of cessation, because satkāyadṛṣṭi (the view of individuality) and the views of attachments to extremes (i.e., a view that there is or is not postmortem continuity) lead to fear of cessation, and because wrong views repudiate cessation.
取結能障道諦遍知，取餘法為淨故。	(6) The fetter of grasping obstructs full comprehension of the noble truth of the path, because one grasps other phenomena as pure.
疑結能障三寶遍知，由此不信受三寶功德故。	(7) The fetter of doubt obstructs full comprehension of the Three Treasures, because one does not have faith in the merits of the Three Treasures as a result of this.
嫉結能障利養恭敬等遍知，由此不見彼過失故。	(8) The fetter of envy obstructs full comprehension of gain and honor, and so forth, because one does not perceive their faults.
慳結能障遠離遍知，由此貪著資生具故。	(9) The fetter of avarice obstructs full comprehension of detachment, because one craves the means to sustain life.
復有別障能障善等十種淨法。	Furthermore, there are specific obstacles that obstruct the ten types of pure phenomena, which relate to virtue and so forth.
其相云何？ 頌曰：   無加行非處，   不如理不生，   不起正思惟，   資糧未圓滿。	What are their characteristics? The verses read as follows:
闕種性善友，   心極疲厭性，   及闕於正行，   鄙惡者同居； 倒麁重三餘，   般若未成熟，   及本性麁重，   懈怠放逸性； 著有著資財，   及心性下劣，   不信無勝解，   如言而思義； 輕法重名利，   於有情無悲，   匱聞及少聞，   不修治妙定。	(1) The absence of application, (2) [application in] inappropriate places, (3) erroneous conduct, (4) nonarising [of the virtuous Dharma], (5) not producing correct thought, (6) incomplete preparations, the lack of (7) spiritual lineage and (8) virtuous friends, (9) mental exhaustion, (10) lacking in correct practice, living together with (11) base and (12) wicked people, (13) cognitive debilitation, (14) the remainders among the three, (15) the immaturity of wisdom, (16) inherent debilitations, (17) laziness, (18) negligence, (19) attachment to existence, (20) attachment to wealth, (21) a dissolute state of mind, (22) lack of faith, (23) the absence of determination, (24) deliberation according to language, (25) disdain for the Dharma, (26) veneration of name and gain, (27) lack of compassion for sentient beings, (28) deficient learning and (29) little learning, and (30) lack of cultivation of meditative concentration. Chapter Two Commentary:
論曰：如是名為善等法障。	These are called obstacles to virtue, etc.
所障善等其相云何？	What are the characteristics of virtue, etc. that are obstructed?
頌曰：   善菩提攝受，   有慧無亂障，   迴向不怖慳，   自在名善等。	The verse reads as follows: “Virtue, etc.” refers to: (1) virtue, (2) bodhi (awakening), (3) sustaining, (4) possession of wisdom, the absence of (5) confusion and (6) obstacles, (7) dedication, the lack of (8) fear and (9) avarice, and (10) mastery.
論曰：如是善等十種淨法，誰有前說幾種障耶？	Commentary: With respect to these ten types of pure phenomena as they relate to virtue etc., which ones encompass which of the aforementioned types of obstacles?
頌曰：   如是善等十，   各有前三障。	The verse reads as follows: These ten (virtue, etc.) are each are beset with three obstacles to start with. Commentary:
論曰：善有三障，一無加行，二非處加行，三不如理加行。	Virtue is beset with three obstacles: (1) the absence of application, (2) application in inappropriate places, (3) application in erroneous conduct.
菩提有三障，一不生善法，二不起正思惟，三資糧未圓滿。	Awakening is beset with three obstacles: (1) nonarising of wholesome phenomena, (2) not giving rise to correct thought, (3) lack of complete preparation.
發菩提心名為攝受，此有三障，一闕種性、二闕善友、三心極疲厭性。	The generation of the mind of awakening (bodhicitta) is called “sustaining.” This is beset with three obstacles: (1) lack of spiritual lineage, (2) lack of virtuous friends, (3) mental exhaustion.
有慧者，謂菩薩，於了此性有三種障，一闕正行、二鄙者共住、三惡者共住。	“Possession of wisdom” refers to the bodhisattva who comprehends this nature; for them there are three obstacles: (1) lack of correct practice, (2) living together with base people, (3) living together with the wicked.
此中鄙者，謂愚癡類，樂毀壞他名為惡者。	Here “base people” refers to deluded types. Those who delight in the destruction of others are called the wicked.
無亂有三障，一顛倒麁重、二煩惱等三障中隨一有餘性、三能成熟解脫慧未成熟。 性障斷滅名無障，此有三障，一俱生麁重、二懈怠性、三放逸性。	The absence of confusion is beset with three obstacles: (1) the debilitations of cognitive distortion, (2) the residual qualities accompanying each of the three obstacles [of the afflictions, karma, and karmic fruition in the form of unfavorable rebirths], (3) the immaturity of wisdom that enables the maturation of liberation. The elimination of inherent obstacles is called the absence of obstacles. This is beset with three obstacles: (1) being born with congenital debilitations, (2) laziness, (3) negligence.
迴向有三障，令心向餘不向無上正等菩提，一貪著諸有、二貪著資財、三心下劣性。	Dedication is beset with three obstacles that make the mind face the other way, rather than facing unexcelled perfect awakening: (1) attachment to existence, (2) attachment to wealth, (3) a dissolute mind.
不怖有三障，一不信重補特伽羅、二於法無勝解、三如言而思義。	The absence of fear is beset with three obstacles: (1) lack of faith in persons, (2) absence of determination with respect to the Dharma, (3) deliberation according to language.
不慳有三障，一不尊重正法、二尊重名譽利養恭敬、三於諸有情心無悲愍。	The absence of avarice is beset with three obstacles: (1) lack of veneration of the true Dharma, (2) venerating name, gain, and honors, (3) lack of compassion for sentient beings.
自在有三障令不得自在，一匱聞生長能感匱法業故、二少聞、三不修治勝三摩地。	Mastery is beset with three obstacles that prevent one from gaining mastery: (1) deficient learning that emerges as a result of karma capable of causing deficiencies with respect to the Dharma, (2) little learning, (3) lack of cultivation of superior samādhi.
復次如是諸障於善等十，隨餘義中有十能作，即依彼義應知此名。	Furthermore, these obstacles have ten activations accompanying their other meanings with respect to the ten types (virtue, etc.). These should be known according to their respective meanings. The ten activations are as follows:
十能作者：一生起能作，如眼等於眼識等。	to the visual consciousness and other consciousnesses.
二安住能作，如四食於有情。 三任持能作，謂能任持，如器世間於有情世間。 四照了能作，如光明於諸色。 五變壞能作，如火等於所熟等。 六分離能作，如鎌等於所斷等。	food, sensory food, and nourishment from thought and the six consciousnesses] consumed by beings. provided by the receptacle world for sentient beings. which is cooked. what is cut.
七轉變能作，如金師等轉變金等成鐶釧等。	so forth who make metals into bracelets and such things.
八信解能作，如烟等於火等。 九顯了能作，如因於宗。	indicates fire]. a premise.
十至得能作，如聖道等於涅槃等。 依如是義，故說頌言：   「能作有十種，   謂生、住、持、照、   變、分離、轉變、   信解、顯、至得，   如識、因、食、地、   燈、火、鎌、工巧，   烟、因聖道等，   於識等所作。 」於善等障，應知亦然。	to nirvana, etc. On the basis of such meanings, the following verses are stated: Chapter Two There are ten types of activations:
一生起障，謂於其善，以諸善法應生起故。 二安住障，謂於菩提，以大菩提不可動故。 三任持障，謂於攝受，以菩提心能任持故。	(1) arising, (2) subsistence, (3) preservation, (4) illumination, (5) alteration, (6) separation, (7) transformation, (8) belief, (9) intellectual expression, and (10) attainment.
四照了障，謂於有慧，以有慧性應照了故。 五變壞障，謂於無亂，轉滅迷亂名變壞故。 六分離障，謂於無障，此於障離繫故。	Examples of consciousnesses, the four foods, the ground, the lamp, the fire, the sickle, the craftsman, smoke, reason, and the noble path relate to the activities of consciousnesses.15 The obstacles as they relate to virtue, etc., should be understood in the same way: phenomena should arise. Great awakening is unshakeable. mind of awakening serves to preserve. wisdom (intelligence). Intelligence should be illuminated.
七轉變障，謂於迴向，以菩提心轉變相故。 八信解障，謂於不怖，無信解者有怖畏故。	mind of awakening is of a transformative characteristic. belief have fear.
九現了障，謂於不慳，於法無慳者，為他顯了故。 十至得障，謂於自在此是能得自在相故。	of avarice. Those without avarice toward the Dharma reveal it to others. it one can attain the characteristics of mastery.
所障十法次第義者，謂有欲證無上菩提，於勝善根先應生起，勝善根力所任持故，必得安住無上菩提。 為令善根得增長故，次應發起大菩提心，此菩提心與菩薩性為所依止。	The point of the order of the ten things [listed above] that are obstructed is that if there is a desire to realize unexcelled awakening, superior virtuous roots should first be produced, since it (i.e., the desire for realization) will be preserved by the power of those superior virtuous roots. One will definitely gain the ability to abide in unexcelled awakening, having made virtuous roots grow. Next, one should generate the mind of great awakening.
如是菩薩由已發起大菩提心及勝善根力所持故，斷諸亂倒起無亂倒。	This mind of awakening is the basis for the bodhisattva nature, since the bodhisattva in this way has generated the mind of great awakening and is supported by the power of superior virtuous roots.
由見道中無亂倒故，次於修道斷一切障。	They sever cognitive errors and give rise to the state of freedom from errors, since on the path of seeing there are no cognitive errors. Next, on the path of cultivation one severs all obstacles.
既斷障已，持諸善根迴向無上正等菩提。	Having severed the obstacles and maintaining virtuous roots, one dedicates themself to unexcelled perfect awakening.
由迴向力所任持故，於深廣法便無怖畏。	As a result of the support of the power of one’s dedication to it, there will then be no fear with respect to the profound Dharma.
既無怖畏，便於彼法見勝功德，能廣為他宣說開示。	Having no fear, one will then witness the superior merits of that Dharma and be able to explain it widely to others.
菩薩如是種種功德力所持故，疾證無上正等菩提，於一切法皆得自在，是名善等十義次第。	Since the bodhisattva is supported by the power of these various merits, they quickly realize unexcelled perfect awakening and attain complete mastery over all phenomena. This is called the order of the meanings with respect to the ten (virtue, etc.).
雖善等法即是覺分波羅蜜多諸地功德，而總別異，今應顯彼菩提分等諸障差別。	Although these phenomena (virtue, etc.) comprise the factors of awakening, there are still general and specific differences so far as the perfections and the qualities of the various grounds (bhūmis) of practice are concerned. Now I will explain the differences among the obstacles to the factors of awakening, etc.
頌曰：   於覺分度地，   有別障應知。	The verse reads as follows: There are specific obstacles that should be understood with respect to the factors of awakening, the perfections, and the grounds.
論曰：復於覺分波羅蜜多諸地功德，各有別障。	Commentary: Again, with respect to the the factors of awakening, the perfections, and the qualities of the various grounds, each have their respective specific obstacles.
於菩提分有別障者，頌曰：   於事不善巧，   懈怠、定減二，   不植羸劣性，   見麁重過失。	With respect to the specific obstacles of the factors of awakening, the verse reads as follows: (1) Lack of skill with respect to objects of meditation, (2) laziness, (3) the two deficiencies in meditation, (4) not planting, (5) weakness, and the faults of (6) false view and (7) debilitations.
論曰：於四念住有於諸事不善巧障。	Commentary: The obstacle of being unskillful in regard to specific objects of meditation is seen in the four bases of mindfulness.
於四正斷有懈怠障。	The obstacle of laziness impedes the four types of correct elimination.
於四神足有三摩地減二事障，一於圓滿欲勤心觀隨減一故、二於修習八斷行中隨減一故。	The obstacle of the two deficiencies in samādhi exist in relation to the four supernormal powers. The first is due to deficiencies in the completion [of meditation]: by way of either will, effort, mind, or contemplation. The second is due to deficiencies in Chapter Two practice: by way of being deficient in at least one of the eight practices of severance.
於五根有不植圓滿順解脫分勝善根障。	The obstacle to the development of the superior virtuous roots lies in the lack of planting perfected factors that are conducive to liberation, such as the five spiritual faculties.
於五力有羸劣性障，謂即五根由障所雜有羸劣性。	The obstacle of weakness impedes five powers, referring to the five spiritual faculties beset with weakness as a result of interference by obstacles.
於七等覺支有見過失障，此是見道所顯示故。	The obstacle of errors in view impedes the seven factors of awakening. These are revealed during the path of seeing.
於八聖道支有麁重過失障，此是修道所顯示故。	The obstacle of debilitating faults impedes the branches of the Eightfold Noble Path. These are revealed during the path of cultivation.
於到彼岸有別障者，頌曰：   障富貴、善趣、   不捨諸有情、   於失德減增、   令趣入、解脫，   障施等諸善、   無盡亦無間、   所作善決定、   受用法成熟。	Concerning the specific obstacles to reaching the other shore (the perfections), the verses read as follows: Obstacles to (1) being wealthy, (2) birth in a favorable existence, (3) not abandoning sentient beings, (3) the decrease of faults and the increase of merits, (4) introducing beings to the Dharma and (5) liberation, obstacles to the (6) virtues of generosity etc., the (7) inexhaustible and (8) uninterrupted, (9) the skillful determination that is made, and (10) the maturation of the Dharma to be enjoyed. Commentary:
論曰：此說十種波羅蜜多所得果障，以顯十種波羅蜜多自性之障。	Here I explain the obstacles that impede the results attained via the ten perfections, to show the obstacles as they pertain to the inherent qualities of the ten perfections.
謂於布施波羅蜜多說富貴自在障；	The obstacle to mastery (i.e., having financial means) is explained as an impediment to the perfection of giving.
於淨戒波羅蜜多說善趣障；	The obstacle to being reborn in a favorable existence is explained as an impediment to the perfection of morality.
於安忍波羅蜜多說不捨有情障；	The obstacle to not abandoning sentient beings is explained as an impediment to the perfection of patience.
於精進波羅蜜多說減過失增功德障；	The obstacle to the reduction of error and increase of merit is explained as an impediment to the perfection of effort.
於靜慮波羅蜜多說令所化趣入法障；	The obstacle to introducing the Dharma to those beings to be taught is explained as an impediment to the perfection of meditation.
於般若波羅蜜多說解脫障；	The obstacle to liberation is explained as an impediment to the perfection of wisdom.
於方便善巧波羅蜜多說施等善無窮盡障，由此迴向無上菩提，令施等善無窮盡故；	The obstacle to being inexhaustible with respect to the virtues of generosity and so forth is explained as an impediment to the perfection of skill in means. It is due to turning from here toward unexcelled awakening that the virtues of generosity and so forth are made inexhaustible.
於願波羅蜜多說一切生中善無間轉障，由大願力攝受能順善法生故；	The obstacle to uninterrupted transmission of virtue through all rebirths is explained as an impediment to the perfection of vows. Wholesome phenomena arise through receiving and being accordant with the power of great vows.
於力波羅蜜多說所作善得決定障，由思擇力及修習力能伏彼障，非彼伏故；	The obstacle to the firm attainment of produced virtues is explained as an impediment to the perfection of power. The powers of discernment and practice can subdue that obstacle, rather than one being subdued by it.
於智波羅蜜多說自他受用法成熟障，不如聞言而覺義故。	The obstacle to the maturation of Dharma, enjoyed by both oneself and others, is explained as an impediment to the perfection of gnosis. Realization of meaning is unlike the words one has heard.
於地功德有別障者，頌曰：   遍行與最勝，   勝流及無攝，   相續無差別，   無雜染清淨，   種種法無別，   及不增不減，   并無分別等，   四自在依義。	There are specific obstacles with respect to the qualities of each of the grounds. The verses read as follows: (1) Omnipresence, (2) supremacy, (3) superior flow of continuity, (4) nongrasping, (5) uninterrupted continuity, (6) absence of both defilements and purity, (7) absence of distinction among various phenomena, (8) neither increasing nor decreasing, (9) the four masteries of nondiscrimination, etc., (10) the truth of the basis.
於斯十法界，   有不染無明，   障十地功德，   故說為十障。	Among these ten experiential realms there exists undefiled ignorance. There are obstacles to the qualities of the ten grounds, hence ten obstacles are explained. Commentary:
論曰：於遍行等十法界中有不染無知障，十地功德如次建立為十地障。	With respect to “omnipresence,” etc., the ten experiential realms are impeded by the obstacle of undefiled ignorance. The obstacles to the ten grounds (bhūmis) are set forth according to the qualities of the ten grounds.
謂初地中所證法界名遍行義，由通達此，證得自他平等法性。	The experiential realm realized on the first ground is called the principle of omnipresence. Having reached here, one realizes the dharma-nature in which self and other are equal.
第二地中所證法界名最勝義，由通達此，作是思惟：是故我今於同出離一切行相應遍修治，是為勤修相應出離。	The experiential realm realized on the second ground is called the principle of the supreme. Having reached here, one thinks, “Now having thus achieved the [aforementioned] liberation of sameness [of self and other], purifying practices should be carried out in every way.” This is diligence concomitant with liberation.
第三地中所證法界名勝流義，由通達此，知所聞法是淨法界最勝等流，為求此法，設有火坑量等三千大千世界，投身而取不以為難。	The experiential realm realized on the third ground is called the principle of the superior flow of continuity. Having reached here, one knows that the Dharma that has been heard is of a pure experiential realm, flowing from that which is supreme and so forth. In seeking this Dharma, one would not consider it difficult to try to grasp hold of it even if one were cast into a flaming pit as vast as trichiliocosm.
第四地中所證法界名無攝義，由通達此，乃至法愛亦皆轉滅。	Chapter Two The experiential realm realized on the fourth ground is called the principle of nongrasping. Having reached here, even love for the Dharma is completely extinguished.
第五地中所證法界名為相續無差別義，由通達此，得十意樂平等淨心。	The experiential realm realized on the fifth ground is called the principle of uninterrupted continuity. Having reached here, one attains the pure mind in which there is equality of the ten aspirations.
第六地中所證法界名無雜染無清淨義，由通達此，知緣起法無染無淨。	The experiential realm realized on the sixth ground is called the principle of the absence of both defilements and purity. Having reached here, one understands that the dharma of dependent origination is neither defiled nor pure.
第七地中所證法界名種種法無差別義，由通達此，知法無相，不行契經等種種法相中。	The experiential realm realized on the seventh ground is called the principle of the absence of distinction among various phenomena. Having reached here, one understands that phenomena are without characteristics, without traversing through the various dharma characteristics in the scriptures, etc.
第八地中所證法界名不增不減義，由通達此，圓滿證得無生法忍，於諸清淨雜染法中不見一法有增有減。	The experiential realm realized on the eighth ground is called the principle of neither increasing nor decreasing. Having reached here, one perfectly realizes the tolerance based on the nonproduction of phenomena. Not a single phenomenon is perceived to increase or decrease among pure and defiled phenomena.
有四自在：一無分別自在、二淨土自在、三智自在、四業自在。	There are four kinds of mastery: (1) mastery of nondiscrimination, (2) mastery of purifying the realm, (3) mastery of cognition, (4) mastery of karma.
法界為此四種所依，名四自在所依止義。	The experiential realm is the support for these four types, meaning it is the principle of support for these four kinds of mastery.
第八地中唯能通達初二自在所依止義。	On the eighth ground, one attains the first two kinds of mastery, which serve as bases.
第九地中亦能通達智自在所依義，圓滿證得無礙解故。	On the ninth ground, one also attains the base of the mastery of cognition. One completely realizes unobstructed cognition.
第十地中復能通達業自在所依義，隨欲化作種種利樂有情事故。	On the tenth ground, one can furthermore attain the base of the mastery of karma. One manifests various benefits and joys for sentient beings as one wishes.
復略頌曰：   已說諸煩惱，   及諸所知障，   許此二盡故，   一切障解脫。	The summary verse reads as follows: Having explained the afflictive and cognitive obstacles, consider the extinguishing of these two as liberation from all obstacles.
論曰：由此二種攝一切障故，許此盡時一切障解脫。	Commentary: Since these two categories include all obstacles, it is held that liberation from all obstacles is attained when these are extinguished.
前障總義有十一種：一廣大障，謂具分障。 二狹小障，謂一分障。 三加行障，謂增盛障。 四至得障，謂平等障。 五殊勝障，謂取捨生死障。 六正加行障，謂九煩惱障。 七因障，謂於善等十能作障。 八入真實障，謂覺分障。 九無上淨障，謂到彼岸障。 十此差別趣障，謂十地障。	The general meaning of the earlier obstacles encompasses eleven types: (1) major obstacles, which refer to whole obstacles; (2) minor obstacles, which refer to partial obstacles; (3) obstacles to application, which refer excessive obstacles; (4) obstacles to attainment, which refer to normal obstacles; (5) obstacles to extraordinary attainments, which refer to obstacles related to grasping and rejecting samsara; (6) obstacles to proper application, which refer to the nine obstacles related to afflictions (i.e., the nine fetters); (7) obstacles to the causes, which refer to obstacles related to the ten activations of virtue and so forth; (8) obstacles to penetrating reality, which refer to obstacles to the factors of awakening; (9) obstacles to unsurpassed purity, which refer to obstacles to reaching the other shore; (10) obstacles to distinctions in paths, which refer to obstacles to the ten [bodhisattva] grounds; (11) the complete array of obstacles are summarized into the two obstacles.
十一攝障，謂略二障。 辯中邊論卷上辯中邊論卷中世親菩薩造大唐三藏法師玄奘奉　詔譯辯真實品第三已辯其障，當說真實。	End of Part I of the Madhyāntavibhāga-bhāṣya Part II Chapter Three Discussion of Reality Having discussed the obstacles, I will explain reality.
頌曰：   真實唯有十，   謂根本與相、   無顛倒、因果，   及麁細真實、   極成、淨所行、   攝受并差別，   十善巧真實，   皆為除我見。	The verses read as follows: Reality consists of only ten [types]: the realities that are (1) fundamental, (2) characteristic, (3) undistorted, (4) according to cause and effect, (5) coarse and subtle, (6) the logically accepted, (7) the sphere of purity, (8) inclusive, (9) differentiated, and (10) discerned through the ten skills, all of which remove views of self.

論曰：應知真實唯有十種，一根本真實、二相真實、三無顛倒真實、四因果真實、五麁細真實、六極成真實、七淨所行真實、八攝受真實、九差別真實、十善巧真實。	It should be understood that there are only ten types of reality: (1) fundamental reality, (2) the reality of characteristic, (3) undistorted reality, (4) the reality of cause and effect, (5) coarse and subtle reality, (6) the reality of that which is accepted (axioms), (7) the reality of the purified sphere, (8) the inclusive reality, (9) the differentiated reality, (10) the reality of skills.
此復十種，為欲除遣十我見故。	This [the reality of skills] encompasses a further ten types, [all of which reflect] the intention to remove the ten types of self-view. The ten skills [for approaching reality] are (1) skillful [contemplation of reality through] the aggregates, (2) skillful [contemplation of reality through] the perceptual bases.
十善巧者，一蘊善巧、二界善巧、三處善巧、四緣起善巧、五處非處善巧、六根善巧、七世善巧、八諦善巧、九乘善巧、十有為無為法善巧。	(3) skillful [contemplation of reality through] the sense bases, (4) skillful [contemplation of reality through] dependent origination, (5) skillful [contemplation of reality through] the appropriate and inappropriate, (6) skillful [contemplation of reality through] the faculties, (7) skillful [contemplation of reality through] time, (8) skillful [contemplation of reality through] the truths, (9) skillful [contemplation of reality] in relation to the vehicles, (10) skillful [contemplation of reality through] conditioned and unconditioned phenomena.
此中云何根本真實？	Herein, what is the fundamental reality?
謂三自性，一遍計所執自性、二依他起自性、三圓成實自性，依此建立餘真實故。	It refers to the three natures: (1) the nature of the conceptualized, (2) the nature of the other-dependent, (3) the nature of the perfectly accomplished. The other realities are established based on these.
於此所說三自性中，許何義為真實？	What is considered to be the meaning of reality here in relation to the stated three natures?
頌曰：   許於三自性，   唯一常非有，   一有而不真，   一有無真實。	The verse reads as follows: Considered as the reality of the three natures: solely, one is always nonexistent, one is existent but is unreal, and one is existent and nonexistent.
論曰：即於如是三自性中：遍計所執相常非有。	Commentary: In this manner, among the three natures, the characteristic of the conceptualized is permanently nonexistent.
唯常非有，於此性中許為真實，無顛倒故。	Being permanently nonexistent, this nature is considered real because of the absence of cognitive distortion.
依他起相有而不真。	The characteristic of other-dependency exists but is unreal.
唯有非真，於依他起許為真實，有亂性故。	Only existing but unreal, the other-dependent is considered real because of confusion.
圓成實相亦有非有。	The characteristic of the perfectly accomplished is both existent and nonexistent.
唯有非有，於此性中許為真實，有空性故。	Only existent and nonexistent, this nature is considered a reality because of emptiness.
云何相真實？	What is the reality of characteristics? The verses read as follows:
頌曰：   於法數取趣，   及所取能取，   有非有性中，   增益損減見；	Reifying and negating views regarding phenomena and the transmigrating person, the grasped and the grasper, and existence and nonexistence are discontinued having understood this.
知此故不轉，   是名真實相。	This is called the reality of characteristics. Commentary:
論曰：於一切法補特伽羅所有增益及損減見，若知此故彼便不轉，是遍計所執自性真實相。	If all reifying and negating views of all phenomena and persons are understood in this way, then they will be discontinued. This is the characteristic of reality of the conceptualized nature.
於諸所取能取法中所有增益及損減見，若知此故彼便不轉，是名依他起自性真實相。	If all reifying and negating views of grasped and grasper are understood in this way, their activities will be discontinued. This is the characteristic of reality of the otherdependent nature.
於有非有所有增益及損減見，若知此故彼便不轉，是名圓成實自性真實相。	If all reifying and negating views of existence and nonexistence are understood in this way, they will be discontinued. This is the characteristic of reality of the perfectly accomplished nature.
此於根本真實相中無顛倒故，名相真實。	Since there is no cognitive distortion within the characteristics of fundamental reality, it is called the reality of characteristics.
無顛倒真實者，謂無常、苦、空、無我性，由此治彼常等四倒。	The reality of the absence of cognitive distortions refers to impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and not-self. Through these one corrects the four cognitive distortions, such as those related to permanence and so forth.
云何應知此無常等依彼根本真實立耶？	How should one understand that impermanence and so forth are established based upon the fundamental reality?
頌曰：   無性與生滅、   垢淨三無常；	The verses read as follows: Chapter Three Nonexistence, arising-ceasing, and defilement-purity constitute three types of (1) impermanence.
所取及事相、   和合苦三種；	The grasped, characteristics of things, and union constitute three types of (2) suffering.
空亦有三種，   謂無、異、自性；	(3) Emptiness also includes three types: nonexistence, variant, and intrinsic natures.
無相及異相、   自相三無我。	Absence of characteristics, variant characteristic, and intrinsic characteristic are the three types of (4) not-self.
如次四三種，   依根本真實。	[These] four each [encompass] three types on the basis of fundamental reality. Commentary:
論曰：無常三者，一無性無常，謂遍計所執，此常無故； 二生滅無常，謂依他起，有起盡故； 三垢淨無常，謂圓成實，位轉變故。	(1) The three types of impermanence are (1) Impermanence due to nonexistence, which refers to the conceptualized nature, since this is always nonexistent; (2) impermanence of arising and ceasing, which refers to the other-dependent nature, since there is origination and cessation; (3) the impermanence of defilement and purity, which refers to the perfectly accomplished nature, since the status of things is changeable.
苦三種者，一所取苦，謂遍計所執，是補特伽羅法執所取故； 二事相苦，謂依他起，三苦相故； 三和合苦，謂圓成實，苦相合故。	(2) The three types of suffering are (1) suffering due to the grasped, which refers to the conceptualized nature, since personhood and phenomena are grasped; (2) suffering due to the characteristics of things, which refers to the other-dependent nature, because of the three characteristics of suffering; (3) suffering due to union, which refers to the perfectly accomplished nature, because of being bound up with suffering.
空有三者，一無性空，謂遍計所執，此無理趣可說為有，由此非有說為空故；	(3) The three types of emptiness are (1) emptiness due to nonexistence, which refers to the conceptualized nature. There is no line of reasoning by which it can be said to be existence.
二異性空，謂依他起，如妄所執不如是有，非一切種性全無故； 三自性空，謂圓成實，二空所顯為自性故。	From this its nonexistence is said to be emptiness; (2) emptiness related to variant nature, which refers to the otherdependent nature, since what is grasped in delusion does not exist in such a manner, yet is not entirely bereft of qualities; (3) emptiness related to intrinsic nature, which refers to the perfectly accomplished, since its intrinsic nature is that which is revealed by the emptiness of the two.
無我三者，一無相無我，謂遍計所執，此相本無故名無相，即此無相說為無我；	(4) The three types of not-self are (1) not-self [stemming from] no characteristics, which refers to the conceptualized nature. Since these characteristics are fundamentally nonexistent, it is therefore said to be without characteristics.
二異相無我，謂依他起，此相雖有而不如彼遍計所執故名異相，即此異相說為無我；	This absence of characteristics is said to be not-self; (2) not-self related to possessing variant characteristics, which refers to the other-dependent nature. Although there are these characteristics, they are unlike what is conceptualized, hence the name variant characteristics.
三自相無我，謂圓實成，無我所顯以為自相，即此自相說為無我。	These variant characteristics are called not-self; (3) not-self as intrinsic characteristic, which refers to the perfectly accomplished nature. What is expressed by not-self is to be considered the intrinsic characteristic. This intrinsic characteristic is said to be not-self.
如是所說無常、苦、空、無我四種，如其次第依根本真實各分為三種，四各三種如前應知。	The four matters of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and not-self are as explained in this manner. Each are divided into three types in their respective order based on fundamental reality. Each of the three types of the four should be understood as above.
因果真實謂四聖諦，云何此依根本真實？	The reality of cause and effect refers to the Four Noble Truths. How is this based on fundamental reality?
頌曰：   苦三相已說，   集亦有三種，   謂習氣、等起，   及相未離繫。	The verses read as follows: The three characteristics of suffering having been explained, the noble truth of arising also includes three types: (1) habituated energies, (2) manifestation, and (3) conjunction. The noble truth of cessation includes:
自性、二不生、   垢寂二三滅。	(1) intrinsic nature, (2) the two forms of grasping not having arisen, and (3) two eliminations of defilement.
遍知及永斷、   證得三道諦。	The noble truth of the path includes (1) full comprehension, (2) permanent severance, and (3) realization.
論曰：苦諦有三，謂無常等四各三相，如前已說。	Commentary: The noble truth of suffering includes three types, which refer to the four items (impermanence and so forth), each divided into three characteristics as explained above.
集諦三者，一習氣集，謂遍計所執自性執習氣； 二等起集，謂業煩惱；	The noble truth of arising is threefold: (1) the arising of habituated energies, which refers to the habit energies of attachment to the conceptualized nature; (2) the arising of manifestation, which refers to [the co-arising of] karma and afflictions; (3) the arising of conjunction, which refers to conjunction obstructing thusness.
三未離繫集，謂未離障真如。 滅諦三者，一、自性滅，謂自性不生故；	The noble truth of cessation is threefold:
二、二取滅，謂所取能取二不生故； 三、本性滅，謂垢寂二，即擇滅及真如。	(1) cessation related to intrinsic nature, which is intrinsic nature being unproduced [in the conceptualized nature]; (2) cessation related to the two forms of grasping, which is due to the grasped and the grasper both being unproduced [in the other-dependent nature]; (3) cessation related to original nature, which refers to the two eliminations of taints [in the perfectly accomplished nature], being cessation through analysis and thusness.
道諦三者，一遍知道、二永斷道、三證得道。	The noble truth of the path is threefold: (1) the path as full comprehension, (2) the path as the permanent severance [of afflictions], (3) the path as realization.
應知此中於遍計所執唯有遍知，於依他起有遍知及永斷，於圓成實有遍知及證得，故依此三建立道諦。	One should understand that herein full comprehension is related to the Chapter Three conceptualized; full comprehension and permanent severance are related to the other-dependent; and the perfectly accomplished is related to full comprehension and realization. Thus, the noble truth of the path is established based on these three.
麁細真實，謂世俗勝義諦。	The realities of coarse and subtle refer to the conventional and ultimate truths.
云何此依根本真實？	How is this based on the fundamental reality?
頌曰：   應知世俗諦，   差別有三種，   謂假、行、顯了，   如次依本三。	The verses read as follows: One should understand conventional truth, which is differentiated into three types: (1) nominal, (2) transient, and (3) disclosed, relying on the three fundamental realities in order.
勝義諦亦三，   謂義、得、正行，   依本一無變，   無倒二圓實。	Ultimate truth is also threefold: (1) object, (2) attainment, and (3) correct practice. The two aspects, unchanging based upon fundamental reality and being free from cognitive distortion, are the perfectly accomplished. Commentary:
論曰：世俗諦有三種，一假世俗、二行世俗、三顯了世俗。	Conventional truth includes three types: (1) nominal conventional truth, (2) transient conventional truth, (3) disclosed conventional truth.
此三世俗如其次第，依三根本真實建立。 勝義諦亦三種，一義勝義，謂真如勝智之境名勝義故；	These three conventional truths are established according to their order based on the three fundamental realities. Ultimate truth is also of three types: (1) the ultimate truth of an object.
二得勝義，謂涅槃，此是勝果亦義利故；	The object of supreme wisdom of thusness is called ultimate truth; (2) the ultimate truth of attainment, which refers to nirvana.
三正行勝義，謂聖道，以勝法為義故。	This supreme fruit is also a benefit; (3) the ultimate truth of correct practice, which refers to the noble path. Its purport is the supreme Dharma.
此三勝義，應知但依三根本中圓成實立。	These three ultimate truths should be understood as solely established based on the perfectly accomplished nature (included as one of the three fundamental realities).
此圓成實總有二種，無為、有為有差別故。	This, the perfectly accomplished, generally encompasses two types: the unconditioned and the conditioned, since there are differences.
無為總攝真如涅槃，無變異故，名圓成實。	The unconditioned generally encompasses thusness and nirvana. The perfectly accomplished is so called because it does not change.
有為總攝一切聖道，於境無倒故，亦名圓成實。 極成真實略有二種，一者世間極成真實、二者道理極成真實。	The conditioned generally subsumes all noble paths. The perfectly accomplished is also so called because of the absence of cognitive distortion with respect to its objects. Accepted reality is briefly twofold: (1) conventionally accepted reality, (2) reality accepted according to reason.
云何此二依彼根本真實立耶？	How are these two explained based on the fundamental realities?
頌曰：   世極成依一，   理極成依三。	The verse reads as follows: The conventionally accepted depends upon one. That which is accepted by reason depends upon three. Commentary: Things that are commonly established according to convention are grasped by the intellect through habituation.
論曰：若事世間共所安立，串習隨入覺慧所取，一切世間同執此事是地非火、色非聲等，是名世間極成真實。 此於根本三真實中，但依遍計所執而立。	The whole mundane world grasps these phenomena: “This is earth, and not fire. This is form, and not sound,” and so forth. This is called the conventionally accepted reality.
若有理義聰叡賢善能尋思者，依止三量證成道理施設建立，是名道理極成真實。	This one is solely established based on the conceptualized (one of the three fundamental realities). One who is skillful and learned in logic establishes [proofs] via reasoned argumentation based on the three means of valid cognition. This is called [knowledge of] reality accepted by reason.
此依根本三真實立。	This is established based on the three fundamental realities.
淨所行真實亦略有二種，一煩惱障淨智所行真實、二所知障淨智所行真實。	The reality of the purified sphere also briefly includes two types: (1) the reality of the sphere of cognition purified of afflictive obstacles, (2) the reality of the sphere of cognition purified of cognitive obstacles.
云何此二依彼根本真實而立？	How are these two established based on fundamental reality?
頌曰：   淨所行有二，   依一圓成實。	The verse reads as follows: The purified sphere includes two, dependent upon one; namely, the perfectly accomplished. Commentary:
論曰：煩惱、所知二障，淨智所行真實，唯依根本三真實中圓成實立，餘二非此淨智境故。	The reality of the sphere of cognition purified of the two obstacles (afflictive and cognitive) is established solely on the perfectly accomplished (one of the three fundamental realities), since the other two are not objects of this pure cognition.
云何應知相名分別真如正智攝在根本三真實耶？	How should we know that characteristics, names, discrimination, thusness, and accurate cognition are included among the three fundamental realities? The verse reads as follows:
頌曰：   名遍計所執，   相分別依他，   真如及正智，   圓成實所攝。	Names depend upon the conceptualized. Characteristics and discrimination are other-dependent. Thusness and accurate cognition are included in the perfectly accomplished. Commentary:
論曰：相等五事，隨其所應，攝在根本三種真實，謂名攝在遍計所執相，及分別攝在依他，圓成實攝真如正智。 差別真實略有七種：一流轉真實、二實相真實、三唯識真實、四安立真實、五邪行真實、六清淨真實、七正行真實。	The five factors of characteristics and so forth, according to the situation, are included in the three types of fundamental reality: (1) names are included in the conceptualized, (2) characteristics and (3) discrimination are included in the other-dependent. The perfectly accomplished includes (4) thusness and (5) accurate cognition. The reality of differentiation briefly includes seven types: (1) continuing reality, (2) accurately characterized reality, (3) the reality of consciousness Chapter Three only, (4) posited reality, (5) the reality of wrong practices, (6) pure reality, (7) the reality of correct practices.
云何應知此七真實依三根本真實立耶？	How should one understand that these seven realities are established based on the three fundamental realities?
頌曰：   流轉與安立，   邪行依初二，   實相唯識淨，   正行依後一。	The verse reads as follows: Continuity, positing, and wrong practices depend upon the first two. The accurately characterized, consciousness only, purity, and correct practices depend upon the latter one. Commentary:
論曰：流轉等七，隨其所應，攝在根本三種真實，謂彼流轉安立邪行依根本中遍計所執及依他起，實相唯識清淨正行依根本中圓成實立。	The seven items of continuity and so forth, according to the situation, are included in the three types of fundamental reality: continuity, positing, and wrong practice depend on the conceptualized and other-dependent [fundamental realities]. The accurately characterized, consciousness only, purity, and correct practice depend upon the perfectly accomplished [fundamental reality].
善巧真實，謂為對治十我見故，說有十種。	The reality of skills serves as an antidote to the ten types of self-view, hence ten are explained.
云何於蘊等起十我見耶？	What are the ten types of self-view that arise in relation to the aggregates, etc.?
頌曰：   於蘊等我見，   執、一、因、受者、   作者、自在轉、   增上義及常、   雜染清淨依、   觀、縛解者性。 論曰：於蘊等十法起十種我見，一執、一性、二執因性、三執受者性、四執作者性、五執自在轉性、六執增上義性、七執常性、八執染淨所依性、九執觀行者性、十執縛解者性。	The verse reads as follows: Self-view in relation to the aggregates, etc.[refers to] grasping onto qualities of (1) oneness, (2) a cause, (3) an experiencer, (4) agency, (5) independence, (6) personal sovereignty, (7) permanence, (8) a basis of defilement and purity, (9) contemplation, and (10) bondage and release. Commentary: Ten phenomena in relation to the aggregates, etc. give rise to the ten types of self-view: (1) grasping to oneness, (2) grasping to causality, (3) grasping to being an experiencer, (4) grasping to agency, (5) grasping to a sense of independence, (6) grasping to a sense of personal sovereignty, (7) grasping to a feeling of permanence, (8) grasping to the quality of the basis for defilement and purity, (9) grasping to being a practitioner of meditation (yogi), (10) grasping to the sense of bondage and release.
為除此見，修十善巧。	The ten skills are cultivated in order to remove these views.
云何十種善巧真實依三根本真實建立？	How is the reality of the ten types of skills established based on the three fundamental realities?
以蘊等十無不攝在三種根本自性中故。	The ten matters in relation to the aggregates, etc. are all included among the intrinsic natures of the three types of fundamental realities.
如何攝在三自性中？	How are they included among the three intrinsic natures?
頌曰：   此所執分別，   法性義在彼。	The verse reads as follows: Here the grasped and discriminated; the object of dharma-nature resides there.
論曰：此蘊等十各有三義。 且色蘊中有三義者，一所執義色，謂色之遍計所執性；	Commentary: These ten phenomena in relation to the aggregates, etc. each include three objects.
二分別義色，謂色之依他起性，此中分別以為色故； 三法性義色，謂色之圓成實性。	Three objects are included in the aggregate of form: (1) form as the object of grasping, which refers to the conceptualized nature of form; (2) form as a discriminated object, which refers to the otherdependent nature of form, since form is here conceived by discrimination; (3) form as an object related to dharma-nature, which refers to the perfectly accomplished nature of form.
如色蘊中有此三義，受等四蘊、界等九法各有三義，隨應當知。	The aggregates have these three objects in the same manner as form. The four other aggregates of feeling, etc., and the nine phenomena of the spheres, etc. each have three objects, which should be understood accordingly.
如是蘊等由三義別，無不攝入彼三性中，是故當知十善巧真實皆依根本三真實而立。	These aggregates, etc. are differentiated via the three stated objects, and all of them are encompassed within the three natures. For this reason, one should understand that the realities of the ten skills are all established based on the three fundamental realities.
如是雖說為欲對治十種我見故修蘊等善巧，而未說此蘊等別義。	Although it is explained in this way that the skills with the aggregates, etc. are practiced in order to correct the ten types of selfview, we have yet to explain the specific meaning of these aggregates.
且初蘊義云何應知？	First, what is the meaning of “aggregate”?
頌曰：   非一及總略、   分段義名蘊。	The verse reads as follows: The meanings of multiple, compounded, and separated are included in the term “aggregate.” Commentary:
論曰：應知蘊義，略有三種：一、非一義，如契經言：諸所有色等，若過去若未來若現在、若內若外、若麁若細、若劣若勝、若遠若近。	One should understand that the meaning of the term aggregate generally includes three senses: (1) the meaning of being nonsingular (i.e., multiple). As the sutras state, “All forms, etc., whether they are past, future, present, inner, outer, coarse, subtle, inferior, superior, distant, or near”; (2) the meaning of being compounded.
二、總略義，如契經言：如是一切略為一聚。	As the sutras state, “Like this they are all compounded into one cluster”; (3) the meaning of being separated.
三、分段義，如契經言：說名色蘊等，各別安立色等相故，由斯聚義蘊義得成。	As a sutra states, “It is explained that form and the other aggregates are each defined based upon their characteristics.” The meaning of aggregate is obtained from this meaning of cluster.
又見世間聚義名蘊。	Furthermore, in conventional discourse, a “cluster” is called an “aggregate” (i.e., bundle or collection).
已說蘊義，界義云何？	Having explained the meaning of aggregate, what is the meaning of “element”?
頌曰：   能所取、彼取，   種子義名界。	The verse reads as follows: Chapter Three Grasping, the grasped, and that grasped; the meaning of the seed is expressed as “element.” Commentary:
論曰：能取種子義，謂眼等六內界。	The meaning of grasping seeds refers to the six inner elements of the eye [and other faculties].
所取種子義，謂色等六外界。	The meaning of the grasped seed refers to the six external elements of form, etc.
彼取種子義，謂眼識等六識界。	The meaning of the “that grasped seed” refers to the six elements of consciousness related to the eye consciousness, etc.
已說界義，處義云何？	Having explained the meaning of the elements, what is the meaning of sense bases?
頌曰：   能受、所了境，   用門義名處。	The verse reads as follows: The capacity for experience and the cognized objects, “base” means entryway to experience.
論曰：此中能受受用門義，謂六內處。	Commentary: Herein “experience”: the entryway to experiencing, which refers to the six internal sense bases.
若所了境受用門義，是六外處。	Cognized objects as an entryway to experience refers to the six external sense bases.
已說處義，緣起義云何？	Having explained the meaning of the sense bases, what is the meaning of dependent origination?
頌曰：   緣起義於因、   果、用無增減。	The verse reads as follows: The meaning of dependent origination is to neither reify nor negate cause, effect, and activity. Commentary:
論曰：於因、果、用若無增益及無損減，是緣起義。	The meaning of dependent origination is neither reification nor negation in regard to cause, effect, and activity.
應知此中增益因者，執行等有不平等因。	One should understand that here reification of cause refers to grasping to the idea that the formations, etc., have inconsistent causation (i.e., they are nothing but chance occurrences).
損減因者，執彼無因。	Denial of cause means grasping to the idea that they are without causation.
增益果者，執有我行等緣無明等生。	Reification of effect refers to grasping to the idea that the conditions for formations, such as selfhood, etc., are produced from ignorance, etc.
損減果者，執無明等無行等果。	Denying effect would refer to grasping to the idea that ignorance, etc. do not produce effects such as the formations, etc.
增益用者，執無明等於生行等有別作用。	Reification of activity is grasping to the idea that there exists a separate activity apart from ignorance, etc. that produces the formations, etc.
損減用者，執無明等於生行等全無功能。	Denial of activity is grasping to the idea that there is absolutely no efficacy of ignorance, etc. in the production of the formations, etc.
若無如是三增減執，應知彼於緣起善巧。	One should understand that those who are free from these three types of reification and negation are skilled with respect to dependent origination.
已說緣起義，處非處義云何？	Having explained the meaning of dependent origination, what is the meaning of possible and impossible? The verse reads as follows:
頌曰：   於非愛、愛、淨、   俱生及勝主、   得、行不自在，   是處非處義。	The meaning of possible and impossible is applied to inevitabilities connected to (1) the undesired, (2) the desired, (3) purity, (4) concurrent births, (5) sovereignty, (6) attainment, and (7) conduct.
論曰：處非處義略由七種不得自在，應知其相。	Commentary: The meaning of “possible and impossible” is generally derived from seven types of inevitabilities (i.e., dependent relationships). One should understand their characteristics.
一於非愛不得自在，謂由惡行雖無愛欲而墮惡趣。	unfavorable rebirths as a result of wrong actions, despite having no desire toward this end.
二於可愛不得自在，謂由妙行雖無愛欲而昇善趣。	favorable rebirths as a result of excellent behavior, despite having no desire toward this end.
三於清淨不得自在，謂不斷五蓋、不修七覺支，決定不能作苦邊際。	to bring about an end to suffering without having severed the five obstructions, nor cultivated the seven factors of awakening.
四於俱生不得自在，謂一世界無二如來、二轉輪王俱時出現。	any given world there are no two tathāgatas nor two wheel-turning kings appearing in the world at the same time.
五於勝主不得自在，謂女不作轉輪王等。	becoming wheel-turning kings and so forth.
六於證得不得自在，謂女不證獨覺無上正等菩提。	able to realize the states of pratyekabuddha or the unexcelled awakening [of a buddha].
七於現行不得自在，謂見諦者必不現行害生等事。	perceived the truths does not behave in such a way as to harm sentient beings and so forth, whereas regular beings readily behave like this.
諸異生類容可現行，《多界經》中廣說此等，應隨決了是處非處。	These matters are extensively explained in the Bahudhātuka-sūtra. One should resolutely understand what is possible and impossible.
如是已說處非處義，根義云何？	The meaning of possible and impossible having been explained thus, what is the meaning of the faculties? The verse reads as follows:
頌曰：   根於取、住、續、   用、二淨增上。	The compelling faculties are those that are involved with cognition, persistence, continuity, experience, and the two types of purity. Chapter Three Commentary:
論曰：二十二根依於六事，增上義立，謂於取境眼等六根有增上義，命根於住一期相續有增上義，男女二根於續家族有增上義，於能受用善惡業果樂等五根有增上義，於世間淨信等五根有增上義，於出世淨未知等根有增上義。	The compulsions of the twenty-two faculties are established on [the above-mentioned] six [functions]. This refers to the following: (1) compelling by the six faculties, such as the eye, etc., that cognize external objects; (2) the life faculty compels continuity to persist for a time; (3) the two sexual faculties of male and female compel the continuation of a family; (4) the five faculties of pleasure and so forth compel the capacity to experience the karmic results of positive and negative behavior; (5) the five faculties of faith and so forth compel mundane purity; (6) the [three] faculties of [coming to know] the unknown, [knowing, and of having known] compel transmundane purity.
已說根義，世義云何？	Having explained the meaning of the faculties, what is the meaning of the times?
頌曰：   因果已未用，   是世義應知。	The verse reads as follows: The meaning of the times should be understood as cause and effect having been experienced or not yet experienced.
論曰：應知因果已未受用，隨其所應三世義別。	Commentary: One should understand that cause and effect, as they are already or not yet experienced, are divided accordingly by the three times.
謂於因果俱已受用，是過去義；	Thus, cause and effect having both been experienced means the past.
若於因果俱未受用，是未來義；	If cause and effect are both yet to be experienced, this means the future.
若已受用因、未已受用果，是現在義。	If the cause has already been experienced while the effect has yet to be experienced, this means the present.
已說世義，諦義云何？	Having explained the meaning of time, what is the meaning of the truths?
頌曰：   受及受資糧，   彼所因諸行，   二寂滅對治，   是諦義應知。	The verse reads as follows: One should know these meanings of the truths: feeling and the facilitators of feeling, the activities that cause these, the cessation of the two, and the antidote. Commentary:
論曰：應知諦者即四聖諦。 一苦聖諦，謂一切受及受資糧。	One should understand that “truths” refers to the Four Noble Truths:
契經中說：諸所有受皆是苦故。	of feeling, since the sutras state that all forms of feeling are of suffering.
受資糧者，謂順受法。 二集聖諦，謂即彼苦所因諸行。 三滅聖諦，謂前二種究竟寂滅。 四道聖諦，謂即苦集能對治道。	The facilitators of feeling refer to the mental functions that constitute feeling. the former two.
已說諦義，乘義云何？	Having explained the meaning of the truths, what is the meaning of the vehicles?
頌曰：   由功德過失，   及無分別智，   依他自出離，   是乘義應知。	The verse reads as follows: One should understand the meaning of “vehicle” through merit and faults, as well as nondiscriminating cognition and liberation dependent upon others or oneself.
論曰：應知乘者，謂即三乘，此中如應顯示其義。	Commentary: One should understand that “vehicles” refers to the three vehicles. Their meanings are accordingly elucidated here.
若從他聞涅槃功德、生死過失而起此智，由斯智故得出離者，是聲聞乘。	If a person hears from others the merits of nirvana and the faults of samsara, and then, having given rise to this awareness, they attain liberation based on this awareness, this is called the “vehicle of the hearers” (śrāvakayāna).
不從他聞涅槃功德、生死過失自起此智，由斯智故得出離者，是獨覺乘。	If a person does not hear from another the merits of nirvana and the faults of samsara but comes to this awareness on their own, and attains liberation based on this awareness, this is called the “vehicle of the solitary realizers” (pratyekabuddhayāna).
若自然起無分別智，由斯智故得出離者，名無上乘。	If nondiscriminating cognition is naturally generated and liberation is attained as a result of this awareness, this is called the “unexcelled vehicle” (i.e., Mahayana).
已說乘義，云何有為、無為法義？	The meaning of vehicles having been explained, what is the meaning of conditioned and unconditioned phenomena?
頌曰：   有為、無為義，   謂若假、若因、   若相； 若寂靜、   若彼所觀義。	The verse reads as follows: The meanings of conditioned and unconditioned refer to the nominal, causes, characteristics, quiescence, and what is observed.
論曰：應知此中假謂名等；	Commentary: One should understand that here “the nominal” refers to names and so forth.
因謂種子所攝藏識；	“Causes” refer the store consciousness (ālaya-vijñāna) in which seeds are held.
相謂器身并受用具，及轉識攝意取思惟；	“Characteristics” refer to the container world [i.e., the natural environment of mountains and rivers, etc.], the body, and that which is experienced. The forthcoming consciousnesses includes mentation, grasping (i.e., sensation), and conceptualization.
意謂恒時思量性識；	Mentation refers to constant deliberative activity.
取謂五識取現境故；	Grasping refers to the five consciousnesses, since they grasp present objects.
思惟即是第六意識，以能分別一切境故。	Conceptualization refers to the sixth discriminating consciousness, since it can discriminate all objects.
如是若假、若因、若相及相應法，總名有為。 若寂靜者，謂所證滅及能證道，能寂靜故。	Like this, whether they are designations, Chapter Three cause, characteristic, or concomitant phenomena, they are collectively called “conditioned.” “Quiescence” refers to the cessation that is realized and the path that leads to realization, since it is able to silence [afflictions].
彼所觀義，謂即真如，是寂靜道所緣境故。	That observed object is thusness, since it is the object of the path of quiescence.
如是所說若諸寂靜、若所觀義，總名無為。 應知此中緣蘊等十義所起正知，名蘊等善巧。	Thus, whether it is forms of quiescence or the object observed, they are collectively called “unconditioned.” One should understand the correct knowledge that has arisen concerning the ten meanings in relation to the aggregates, etc. is called skill with the aggregates, etc.
真實總義略有二種，謂即能顯、所顯真實。	The general meaning of reality includes two types in brief: reality that reveals and the reality that is revealed.
能顯真實，謂即最初三種根本，能顯餘故。	Revealing realities refer to the first three types of fundamental realities, since they reveal the others.
所顯真實，謂後九種，是初根本所顯示故。	Revealed realities refer to the latter nine types, since these are revealed by the prior fundamental realities.
所顯九者，一離增上慢所顯真實； 二對治顛倒所顯真實； 三聲聞乘出離所顯真實；	The nine that are revealed include the following: superiority.
四無上乘出離所顯真實，由麁能成熟細能解脫故；	resulting from the coarse brought to maturity and the subtle enabling liberation. others.
五能伏他論所顯真實，依喻導理降伏他故； 六顯了大乘所顯真實； 七入一切種所知所顯真實； 八顯不虛妄真如所顯真實；	One refutes others by utilizing analogies and being guided by reason.
九入我執事一切祕密所顯真實。	and all mysteries.
辯修對治品第四已辯真實，今次當辯修諸對治，即修一切菩提分法。	Chapter Four Discussion of the Cultivation of Antidotes Having explained reality, I will now explain the cultivation of antidotes. This includes the cultivation of all factors of awakening.
此中先應說修念住。	Here I will first explain cultivation of the bases of mindfulness.
頌曰：   以麁重愛因，   我事無迷故，   為入四聖諦，   修念住應知。	The verse reads as follows: In order to understand the Four Noble Truths, one should understand cultivation of the bases of mindfulness through (1) debilitations, (2) the causes of craving, (3) the object of self, and (4) the absence of delusion.
論曰：麁重由身而得顯了，故觀察此入苦聖諦。	Commentary: Debilitations are made manifest through the body, hence it is through the contemplation of this that one understands the noble truth of suffering, since the body is characterized by its possession of debilitations and formations.
身以有麁重諸行為相故，以諸麁重即行苦性，由此聖觀有漏皆苦。	The debilitations are comprised of the qualities of suffering caused by the formations. As a result of this, noble beings view all contamination as suffering.
諸有漏受說為愛因，故觀察此入集聖諦。	Feelings that are contaminated are said to be the causes of craving, thus contemplating this leads to understanding the noble truth of arising.
心是我執所依緣事，故觀察此入滅聖諦，怖我斷滅由斯離故。	The mind is the objective basis for grasping to a self. Thus, contemplating this leads to understanding the noble truth of cessation. One is freed from the fear of the extinction of the self through contemplation of this.
觀察法故，於染淨法遠離愚迷入道聖諦。	Contemplating phenomena leads to understanding the noble truth of the path, in that one becomes far removed from delusion with respect to defiled and pure phenomena.
是故為入四聖諦理，最初說修四念住觀。	Hence, cultivation of the four bases of mindfulness is first explained as a means of understanding the principles of the Four Noble Truths.
已說修念住，當說修正斷。	Having explained cultivation of the bases of mindfulness, I will now explain cultivation of the [four types of] correct elimination.
頌曰：   已遍知障治，   一切種差別，   為遠離修集，   勤修四正斷。	The verse reads as follows: Now able to fully comprehend the antidotes to obstacles in all their differing types, the four types of correct elimination are diligently cultivated in order to be far removed [from obstacles] and to produce [the antidotes].
論曰：前修念住，已能遍知一切障治品類差別。	Commentary: It is through the aforementioned cultivation of the bases of mindfulness that one is able to fully comprehend the differences and distinctions among all obstacles and antidotes.
今為遠離所治障法，及為修集能對治道，於四正斷精勤修習。	Now there is diligent cultivation of the four types of correct elimination in order to be far removed from the obstacles to be remedied, and in order to cultivate a way that corrects.
如說已生惡不善法為令斷故，乃至廣說。	As is explained in detail [elsewhere], this is done so as to eliminate unwholesome states that have already arisen.
已說修正斷，當說修神足。	Having explained cultivation of the correct eliminations, I will explain the cultivation of supernormal powers.
頌曰：   依住堪能性，   為一切事成，   滅除五過失，   勤修八斷行。	The verse reads as follows: On the basis of abiding with adaptability, the eight formative forces of elimination are diligently cultivated to accomplish all things, and to remove the five errors. Commentary:
論曰：依前所修離集精進，心便安住有所堪能，為勝事成修四神足，是諸所欲勝事因故。	The mind abides in stability based upon the aforementioned effort in cultivating the removal [of obstacles] and cultivation [of antidotes]. It then possesses adaptability. The four supernormal powers are cultivated to attain excellent objectives, because these are the causes for the desired excellent objectives.
住謂心住，此即等持故。	Abiding refers to the mind abiding, since this is meditative concentration.
次正斷說四神足，此堪能性，謂能滅除五種過失修八斷行。	The four supernormal powers are explained following the correct eliminations. “Adaptability” refers to the cultivation of the eight formative forces of elimination that can remove the five types of errors.
何者名為五種過失？	What are the five types of errors?
頌曰：   懈怠、忘聖言，   及惛沈、掉舉、   不作行作行，   是五失應知。	The verse reads as follows: These five faults should be understood: (1) laziness, (2) forgetting noble words, (3) laxity and excitement, (4) nonapplication, and (5) application.
論曰：應知此中惛沈掉舉合為一失、若為除滅惛沈掉舉不作加行、或已滅除惛沈掉舉、復作加行俱為過失。	Commentary: It should be understood that herein laxity and excitement are combined as a single fault. Not applying oneself to remove laxity and excitement, or applying additional effort when laxity-excitement have been removed, constitute faults.
為除此五、修八斷行。	Cultivating the eight formative forces of elimination remove these five.
云何安立彼行相耶？	How are the characteristics of those forces established?
頌曰。	The verses read as follows:
為斷除懈怠，   修欲、勤、信、安，   即所依、能依，   及所因、能果。	In order to eliminate laziness, cultivate (1) the desire to do so, (2) effort, (3) faith, and (4) serenity. These constitute the support, that which is sup54 Chapter Four ported, cause, and effect.
為除餘四失，   修念、智、思、捨，   記言覺沈掉，   伏行滅等流。 論曰：為滅懈怠，修四斷行：一欲、二正勤、三信、四輕安。	In order to remove the four faults, cultivate (1) mindfulness, (2) attentiveness, (3) volition, and (4) equanimity, which [respectively constitute] recollection, awareness of laxity-excitement, subjugating activity, and the flow of equanimity following cessation. Commentary: The four activities of elimination are cultivated in order to eliminate laziness: (1) the desire to do so, (2) correct effort, (3) faith, (4) pliancy.
如次應知即所依等。	They should be understood as follows.
所依，謂欲、勤所依故。	They constitute supports and so forth, since “support” refers to the desire, which is the support for effort.
能依，謂勤依欲起故。	“That which is supported” refers to effort, because it arises based upon desire.
所因，謂信是所依欲生起近因，若信受彼便希望故。	“Cause” refers to faith, the support for this being desire, which gives rise to direct causes, since there will be hope if there is belief in that.
能果，謂安是能依勤近所生果，勤精進者得勝定故。	“Result” refers to pliancy, this being a directly caused result of that which is supported (effort), since those who exert themselves attain superior meditative concentration.
為欲對治後四過失，如數修餘四種斷行：一念、二正知、三思、四捨。	The remaining four types of forces of elimination are cultivated with the aim of correcting the latter four faults in sequence: (1) mindfulness, (2) correct attentiveness, (3) volition, (4) equanimity.
如次應知即記言等。	They should be understood in order. These constitute recollection and so forth.
記言謂，念能不忘境，記聖言故。	“Recollection” refers to mindfulness, being the mind's ability to not forget objects, since the words of the sages (i.e., Buddhist teachings) are kept in mind.
覺沈掉者，謂即正知，由念記言便能隨覺惛沈、掉舉二過失故。	“Awareness of laxity and excitement” refers to correct attentiveness, since it is through mindfulness that one is able to remain aware of the two faults of laxity and excitement.
伏行謂思，由能隨覺沈掉失已，為欲伏除發起加行。	“Subjugating activity” refers to volition, since applied action is brought about to remove the faults of laxity and excitement after having become aware of them.
滅等流者，謂彼沈掉既斷滅已，心便住捨平等而流。	“Flow of equanimity following cessation” refers to the mind flowing evenly in equanimity, having eliminated laxity and excitement.
已說修神足，當說修五根。	Having explained the cultivation of the supernormal powers, I will explain cultivation of the five faculties.
所修五根云何安立？	How is the cultivation of the five faculties established?
頌曰：   已種順解脫，   復修五增上，   謂欲、行、不忘、   不散亂、思擇。	The verse reads as follows: Having planted the factors conducive to liberation, further cultivate five overwhelming powers: (1) the desire to act, (2) application, (3) retention, (4) being undisturbed, and (5) critical analysis. Commentary:
論曰：由四神足心有堪能，順解脫分善根滿已，復應修習五種增上：一欲增上、二加行增上、三不忘境增上、四不散亂增上、五思擇增上。	The mind comes to possess adaptability from the four supernormal powers. The virtuous roots having been brought to maturity in relation to the factors conducive to liberation, one should further cultivate five overwhelming powers: (1) the overwhelming power of the desire to act, (2) the overwhelming power of application, (3) the overwhelming power of not forgetting objects [in the mind], (4) the overwhelming power of being undisturbed, (5) the overwhelming power of critical analysis.
此五如次第即信等五根。	These five follow in order after the five faculties of faith and [effort, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom].
已說修五根，當說修五力。	Having explained the cultivation of the five faculties, I will explain the cultivation of the five powers.
何者五力？ 次第云何？	What are the five powers and what is their sequence?
頌曰：   即損障名力，   因果立次第。	The verse reads as follows: Eliminating obstacles is called power. Its order is established as cause and effect.
論曰：即前所說信等五根，有勝勢用復說為力。	Commentary: The aforementioned five faculties of faith and so forth are powerful, and thus they are also called powers.
謂能伏滅不信障等，亦不為彼所陵雜故。	This means that they are able to eliminate the obstacles of disbelief and so forth because they are not mixed up with them.
此五次第依因果立，以依前因引後果故。	The ordering of these five is established based on cause and effect, since it is based on the earlier cause that the latter effect is brought about.
謂若決定信有因果，為得此果發勤精進，勤精進已便住正念，住正念已心則得定，心得定已能如實知，既如實知無事不辦，故此次第依因果立。	If (1) firm faith has a cause and effect, then (2) zeal will be aroused to attain this effect. Once zeal is aroused, one will abide in (3) correct mindfulness. Abiding in correct mindfulness, the mind will attain (4) meditative concentration. The mind having attained meditative concentration, it will be possible to (5) know things as they really are (i.e., wisdom). Knowing things as they really are, there is nothing that one cannot handle. Hence, this order is established based upon cause and effect.
如前所說順解脫分既圓滿已復修五根。 何位修習順決擇分？	As explained earlier, the factors conducive to liberation having been perfected, one further cultivates the five faculties. At what stage does one cultivate the elements conducive to penetrating insight:
為五根位、五力位耶？	is it at the stage of the five faculties or of the five powers?
頌曰：   順決擇二二，   在五根、五力。	The verse reads as follows: Elements conducive to penetrating insight are assigned in pairs to the five faculties and five powers. Commentary:
論曰：順決擇分中暖、頂二種在五根位，忍、世第一法在五力位。	Among the elements conducive to penetrating insight, Chapter Four warmth and the tipping point are assigned to the five faculties. Tolerance and the highest mundane state belong to the five powers.
已說修五力，當說修覺支。	Having explained cultivation of the five powers, I will explain cultivation of the limbs of awakening.
所修覺支云何安立？	How is cultivation of the limbs of awakening established?
頌曰：   覺支略有五，   謂所依、自性、   出離并利益，   及三無染支。	The verse reads as follows: The limbs of awakening briefly comprise five: the limbs of (1) support, (2) intrinsic nature, (3) liberation, (4) benefit, and (5) the three states of freedom from defilement.
論曰：此支助覺故名覺支。	Commentary: These limbs support awakening, which is why they are called the limbs of awakening.
由此覺支位在見道，廣有七種，略為五支。	Since these limbs of awakening are included in the path of seeing, there are broadly seven types, briefly constituting five limbs:
一覺所依支，謂念。 二覺自性支，謂擇法。 三覺出離支，謂精進。 四覺利益支，謂喜。 五覺無染支，此復三種，謂安、定、捨。	(1) the limb that supports awakening refers to mindfulness, (2) the limb of intrinsic nature related to awakening refers to analysis of phenomena, (3) the limb of liberation related to awakening refers to effort, (4) the limb of benefit related to awakening refers to joy, (5) the limb of being freed from defilement is related to awakening—which here is of three additional types: pliancy, meditative concentration, and equanimity.
何故復說無染為三？	Why is it explained that being free from defilement constitutes three further types? The verse reads as follows:
頌曰：   由因緣所依，   自性義差別，   故輕安、定、捨，   說為無染支。	From the specific meanings of (1) causal condition, (2) support, and (3) intrinsic nature, the limbs of freedom from defilement are explained as (1) pliancy, (2) meditative concentration, and (3) equanimity. Commentary:
論曰：輕安即是無染因緣。 麁重為因生諸雜染，輕安是彼近對治故。	Pliancy is the causal condition for freedom from defilement, since debilitations serve as causes to produce various defilements, while pliancy is a direct antidote for that.
所依謂定自性，即捨。	The support refers to meditative concentration. The intrinsic nature is equanimity.
故此無染義別有三。	Hence, this freedom from defilement includes three separate meanings.
說修覺支已，當說修道支。	Having explained the cultivation of the limbs of awakening, I will explain the cultivation of limbs of the path.
所修道支云何安立？	How are the cultivated limbs of the path established?
頌曰：   分別及誨示，   令他信有三，   對治障亦三，   故道支成八。	The verse reads as follows: The limbs of the path constitute eight, namely, (1) ascertaining and (2) instruction; (3–5) leading others to [have] faith includes three; and (6–8) the counteracting of obstacles also includes three.
論曰：於修道位建立道支，故此道支廣八略四。 一分別支，謂正見。	Commentary: The limbs of the path are established at the stage of the path of cultivation, hence these limbs of the path are counted in detail as eight or briefly as four.
此雖是世間而出世後得，由能分別見道位中自所證故。	ascertainment] is used in mundane [cognition], it is also used in the transmundane, subsequently attained [cognition]. This is because it is able to discriminate that which is witnessed in the stage of the path of seeing.16 thought and correct speech.
二誨示他支，謂正思惟、正語一分，等起發言誨示他故。 三令他信支，此有三種，謂正語、正業、正命。 四對治障支，亦有三種，謂正精進、正念、正定。	Others are instructed through utterances. correct speech, correct action, and correct livelihood. effort, correct mindfulness, and correct meditative concentration.
由此道支略四廣八。	In this way, the limbs of the path are elaborated in brief as four and in detail as eight.
何緣後二各分為三？	Why are the latter two each divided into three?
頌曰：   表見戒遠離，   令他深信受，   對治本隨惑，   及自在障故。	The verse reads as follows: Expression, morality, and detachment compel others to deeply believe, since they correct primary and secondary afflictions and the obstacles to mastery.
論曰：正語等三如次表已見戒遠離令他信受。	Commentary: The group of three, including correct speech and so forth, have already been presented respectively. Expression, morality, and detachment cause others to have faith.
謂由正語論議決擇，令他信知已有勝慧。	This means that one causes others to have faith and understanding through debate and resolution carried out with correct speech; hence, one comes to possess superior wisdom.
由正業故不作邪業，令他信知已有淨戒，由正命故應量應時如法乞求衣鉢等物，令他信已有勝遠離。	One leads others to faith and understanding by not carrying out mistaken activity, which results from correct action; and so one possesses pure morality. Leading others to faith through almsbegging in the prescribed manner in the proper proportions at the proper time with items such as robes and a bowl results from correct livelihood; hence one comes to possess superior detachment.
正精進等三如次對治本隨二煩惱及自在障。	The group of three, including correct effort and so forth, in said order correct the two types of afflictions (primary and secondary) as well as obstacles to mastery.
此所對治略有三種：一根本煩惱，謂修所斷；	What is corrected here is generally of three types:
二隨煩惱，謂惛沈掉舉； 三自在障，謂障所引勝品功德。	(1) root afflictions, that is, afflictions eliminated on [the path of] cultivation; (2) secondary afflictions, which refer to laxity and excitement; (3) Obstacles to freedom (mastery), Chapter Four which refer to obstructions to excellent qualities and superior merit that are to be brought about.
此中正精進別能對治初，為對治彼勤修道故。	Herein correct effort specifically corrects the first, since that is corrected as a result of diligent cultivation of the path.
正念別能對治第二，繫念安住止等相中，遠離惛沈及掉舉故。	Correct mindfulness specifically corrects the second, since fixed mindfulness and calm abiding, and being immersed in the signs of meditative absorption, etc., leads one far away from laxity and excitement.
正定別能對治第三，依勝靜慮速能引發諸神通等勝功德故。	Correct meditative concentration corrects the third, since one quickly brings about the supernormal knowledges and superior merits based on superior meditation.
修治差別云何應知？	How should the differences in the cultivation of antidotes be understood?
頌曰：   有倒順無倒，   無倒有倒隨，   無倒無倒隨，   是修治差別。	The verse reads as follows: These are the differences in the cultivation of antidotes: having cognitive distortion but conducive to not having cognitive distortion; not [directly] having cognitive distortions but having ancillary cognitive distortions; and having neither cognitive distortions nor ancillary cognitive distortions.
論曰：此修對治略有三種，一有顛倒順無顛倒、二無顛倒有顛倒隨、三無顛倒無顛倒隨。	Commentary: Here the antidotes to be cultivated are of three general types: (1) possessing cognitive distortion but conducive to the absence of cognitive distortion; (2) free from cognitive distortion but possessing cognitive distortion in accompaniment; (3) the absence of cognitive distortion as well as the absence of cognitive distortion in accompaniment.
如是三種修治差別，如次在異生、有學、無學位菩薩。 二乘所修對治有差別相，云何應知？	The differences in the three types of cultivated antidotes are as follows: ordinary beings, and the states of being engaged in or not being engaged in training. The antidotes cultivated by bodhisattvas and the two vehicles have their distinctive characteristics. How are they to be understood?
頌曰：   菩薩所修習，   由所緣作意，   證得殊勝故，   與二乘差別。	The verse reads as follows: That which the bodhisattva cultivates differs from the two vehicles on account of (1) objective supports, (2) mental orientation, and (3) realization of excellence. Commentary:
論曰：聲聞、獨覺以自相續身等為境而修對治；	(1) Śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas cultivate antidotes with their own bodily continuums as objects.
菩薩通以自他相續身等為境而修對治。	Bodhisattvas cultivate antidotes taking bodily continuums belonging to themselves and others as objects.
聲聞獨覺於身等境，以無常等行相思惟而修對治；	(2) Śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas cultivate antidotes with attention to the aspects of impermanence and so forth, the objects being their bodies, etc.
若諸菩薩於身等境，以無所得行相思惟而修對治。	Bodhisattvas cultivate antidotes with attention to aspects such as noncognition, the object being their bodies, etc.
聲聞獨覺修念住等，但為身等速得離繫；	(3) Śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas cultivate the bases of mindfulness, etc. but just to quickly achieve release from bondage to the body etc.
若諸菩薩修念住等，不為身等速得離繫，但為證得無住涅槃。	Bodhisattvas cultivate the bases of mindfulness, etc. not to quickly achieve release from bondage to the body, etc. but only to realize nonabiding nirvana.
菩薩與二乘所修對治，由此三緣故而有差別。 修對治總義者，謂開覺修； 損減修； 瑩飾修； 發上修； 隣近修，謂隣近見道故； 證入修； 增勝修； 初位修； 中位修；	The antidotes cultivated by bodhisattvas and [those of] the two vehicles include these differences stemming from these three conditions.
後位修； 有上修； 無上修，謂所緣作意至得殊勝。	The general meaning of cultivating antidotes refers to the cultivation of awakening, the cultivation of elimination, the cultivation of adornment, the cultivation of elevation, the cultivation of approaching (referring to approaching the path of seeing), the cultivation of realization, the cultivation of excellence, cultivation in the beginning stages, cultivation in the middle stages, cultivation in the later stages, excellent cultivation, and unexcelled cultivation.
辯修分位品第五已說修對治，修分位云何？	These refer to the objects and mental orientation up to the attainment of the most excellent state.17 Chapter Five Discussion of the Stages of Practice Having explained the cultivation of antidotes, what of the stages of practice?

論曰：此大乘中總由三種無上義故名無上乘。 三無上者，一正行無上、二所緣無上、三修證無上。	Here the Mahayana is called the unexcelled vehicle because of three meanings related to “unexcelled.” The three ways in which it is unexcelled are (1) unexcelled with respect to correct practice, (2) unexcelled with respect to its objective support (basis), (3) unexcelled with respect to the cultivation of realization.

無難最勝者，於他有情所修善法但深隨喜，令自施等波羅蜜多速圓滿故。	“Supremacy of being free from difficulties” results from the swift consummation of perfections, such as generosity and so forth, in which there is deep corresponding delight at wholesome dharmas cultivated by other beings.
自在最勝者，由虛空藏等三摩地力，令所修施等速圓滿故。 攝受最勝者，無分別智之所攝受，能令施等極清淨故。	“Supremacy of mastery [over wealth]” results from the swift consummation of cultivated generosity and so forth stemming from the power of the ākāśagarbha samādhi, etc.18 “Supremacy of reception” results from having gained nondiscriminating cognition that can foster extreme purity in relation to generosity and so forth.
發起最勝者，在勝解行地最上品忍中。	“Supremacy of initiative” is at the highest level of tolerance on the ground of resolute practice.
至得最勝者，在極喜地。	“Supremacy of attainment” is on the ground of extreme joy.
等流最勝者，在次八地。	“Supremacy of natural results” means that results occur naturally on the following eight grounds.

由施等十波羅蜜多皆有如斯十二最勝，是故皆得到彼岸名。	As a result of the ten perfections (generosity, etc.), all [buddhas] possess these twelve types of supremacy. This is why all are said to have reached the other shore.

如是已說最勝正行，作意正行其相云何？	Supreme correct practice having been explained like this, what are the characteristics of correct practice via mental orientation?

論曰：修行如是十種法行，所獲福聚其量無邊。	Commentary: The accumulation of merit gained from practicing these ten acts of Dharma is limitless.
何故但於大乘經等說修法行獲最大果，於聲聞乘不如是說？	Why is it only in the Mahayana sutras that the cultivation of practices that gain the greatest results are taught, whereas the śrāvakayāna does not provide such teachings?
頌曰：   勝故、無盡故，   由攝他不息。	The verse reads as follows: For it is supreme and inexhaustible, due to it ceaselessly benefiting others.
論曰：於此大乘修諸法行，由二緣故獲最大果，一最勝故、二無盡故。	Commentary: Cultivation of these acts of Dharma in the Mahayana gains the greatest results for two reasons: (1) because it is supreme and (2) because it is inexhaustible.
由能攝益他諸有情，是故大乘說為最勝。	The Mahayana is said to be supreme because it can confer benefits to other sentient beings.
由雖證得無餘涅槃，利益他事而恒不息，是故大乘說為無盡。	The Mahayana is said to be inexhaustible because although through it one realizes nirvana without remainder, one still ceaselessly benefits others.
如是已說作意正行，隨法正行其相云何？	Having explained correct practice via mental orientation in this manner, what are the characteristics of correct practice in conformity with the Dharma? The verse reads as follows:
頌曰：   隨法行二種，   謂諸無散亂、   無顛倒轉變，   諸菩薩應知。	Practice in conformity with Dharma comprises two types: (1) freedom from distractions, and (2) freedom from cognitive distortion, in which development occurs. Bodhisattvas should understand these. Commentary:
論曰：隨法正行略有二種，一無散亂轉變、二無顛倒轉變，菩薩於此應正了知。 此中六種散亂無故，名無散亂。	Correct practice in conformity with the Dharma includes two types in brief: (1) development free from distraction, (2) development free from cognitive distortion. The bodhisattva here should correctly comprehend that herein “free from distraction” refers to six types of freedom from distraction.
六散亂者，一自性散亂、二外散亂、三內散亂、四相散亂、五麁重散亂、六作意散亂。	The six distractions are: (1) inherent distraction, (2) external distraction, (3) inner distraction, (4) distraction by signs, (5) distraction by debilitations, (6) distraction in relation to mental orientation.
此六種相云何應知？	How should the characteristics of these six types be understood?
頌曰：   出定、於境流、   味沈掉、矯示、   我執、心下劣，   諸智者應知。	The verse reads as follows: The wise should understand these: (1) emergence from meditation, (2) flowing out to objects, (3) indulgence in sinking and excitement, (4) dissimulation, (5) self-attachment, and (6) inferior mental [orientation]. Commentary:
論曰：此中出定由五識身，當知即是自性散亂。 於境流者，馳散外緣，即外散亂。	Herein one should understand that emergence from meditation through the five bodily consciousnesses is “inherent distraction.” “Flowing [out] to an object” means wandering out to an external object, which is external distraction.
味沈掉者，味著等持惛沈掉舉，即內散亂。	“Indulgence [during] sinking and excitement” refers to indulging in the dullness and agitation of meditative concentration, which is inner distraction.
矯示者，即相散亂，矯現相已修定加行故。 我執者，即麁重散亂，由麁重力我慢現行故。	“Dissimulation” is distraction in relation to signs (nimitta), in which one feigns the appearances (“pretends to do”) of applying oneself to meditative cultivation.19 “Self-grasping” refers to the distraction due to debilitation, since it is through the power of debilitation that conceit manifests.
心下劣者，即作意散亂，依下劣乘起作意故。	“Inferior mentality” is distraction in relation to mental orientation, since one orients oneself toward [the aims of] the inferior vehicles (i.e., the practitioner is satisfied with the nirvana of the two Hinayana vehicles).
菩薩於此六散亂相，應遍了知當速除滅。	The bodhisattva should fully comprehend and quickly eliminate these six characteristics of distractions.
如是已說無散亂轉變，無顛倒轉變云何應知？	Having explained development free from distraction in this manner, how should development free from cognitive distortion be understood?
頌曰：   智見於文義，   作意及不動，   二相染淨客，   無怖高無倒。	The verse reads as follows: The absence of cognitive distortion is to be cognized in relation to (1) syllables, (2) objects, (3) mental orientation, (4) immovability, (5) twofold characteristics, (6) defilement, (7) purity, (8) the adventitious, (9) absence of fear, and (10) absence of arrogance. Chapter Seven Commentary:
論曰：依十事中如實智見，應知建立十無倒名。	One should understand that the ten names of freedom from cognitive distortion are established on the basis of the accurate cognition of ten items.
此中云何於文無倒？	What is freedom from cognitive distortion in regard to syllables? The verse reads as follows:
頌曰：   知但由相應、   串習或翻此，   有義及非有，   是於文無倒。	Know that it is from correspondence, consensus, or the reverse of this that meaning exists or not. This is freedom from cognitive distortion with regard to syllables.
論曰：若於諸文能無間斷次第宣唱，說名相應。	When syllables are pronounced in sequence in an uninterrupted manner, this is called correspondence.
共許此名唯目此事，展轉憶念名為串習。	This name is commonly accepted, as in the case of “this thing only refers to an eye,” in which there is successive recollection [of the object]. This is called consensus.
但由此二，成有義文；	It is only from these two that syllable(s) possessing meaning are constituted.
與此相，違文成無義。	If this were not the case, syllables would not constitute any meaning.
如實知見此二文者，應知是名於文無倒。	One who accurately knows these two types of syllables should understand these names in relation to freedom from cognitive distortion with respect to syllables.
於義無倒其相云何？	What are the characteristics of freedom from cognitive distortion with respect to objects?
頌曰：   似二性顯現，   如現實非有，   知離有非有，   是於義無倒。	The verse reads as follows: The manifestation of the appearance of dual nature is in reality nonexistent. Knowing the separation from existence and nonexistence is freedom from cognitive distortion with respect to objects.
論曰：似二性顯現者，謂似所取能取性現，亂識似彼行相生故。	Commentary: The “manifestation of the appearance of dual nature” refers to the appearance of the manifestation of the qualities of grasped and grasper, since the disturbed consciousness seems to produce those modes of appearance.
如現實非有者，謂如所顯現，實不如是有。	“Nonexistent in reality” means that what is manifest is not existent in such a manner in reality.
離有者，謂此義所取能取性非有故。	“Separation from existence” is because the quality of this object as grasped or grasper is nonexistent.
離非有者，謂彼亂識現似有故。	“Separation from nonexistence” is because that disturbed consciousness manifests the appearance of existence.
如實知見此中義者，應知是名於義無倒。	One who accurately knows the meaning herein should understand that this is called freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to objects.
於作意無倒者，頌曰：   於作意無倒，   知彼言熏習，   言作意彼依，   現似二因故。	With respect to freedom from cognitive distortion in regard to mental orientation, the verse reads as follows: With respect to freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to mental orientation, know that that is perfumed by speech. Mental orientation related to speech is a basis, since it is the cause for the appearance of duality.
論曰：所取能取言所熏習名言作意，即此作意是所能取分別所依，是能現似二取因故。	Commentary: Grasped and grasper are perfumed by speech, and this is called mental orientation related to speech. This mental orientation is the basis for discrimination between grasped and grasper, since this is the cause underlying the appearance of the two forms of grasping.
由此作意是戲論想之所熏習名言作意，如實知見此作意者，應知是於作意無倒。	It is because this mental orientation is perfumed by discursive thinking that it is called mental orientation related to speech. One who accurately knows this mental orientation should understand this freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to mental orientation.
於不動無倒者，頌曰：   於不動無倒，   謂知義非有，   非無如幻等，   有無不動故。	With respect to freedom from cognitive distortion based on immovability, the verse reads as follows: Freedom from cognitive distortion based upon immovability means knowing an object is neither existent nor nonexistent, like illusions, etc.; hence, one remains unmoved by existence and nonexistence. Commentary:
論曰：前說諸義離有非有。 此如幻等非有無故。 謂如幻作諸象馬等彼非實有，象馬等性亦非全無，亂識似彼諸象馬等而顯現故。	Earlier it was explained that objects are free from notions of existence and nonexistence, since these are like illusions and so forth, being neither existent nor nonexistent, meaning that they are not really existent, like elephants and horses and so forth created by illusion. The elephants and horses and so forth in nature are also not entirely nonexistent, since the disturbed consciousness creates the appearances of those elephants and horses.
如是諸義無如現似所取能取定實有性亦非全無，亂識似彼所取能取而顯現，故等聲顯示陽焰夢境及水月等，如應當知。	These objects do not exist in the manner in which they appear, as in the case of an [apparently] definitely real existence of grasped and grasper. They are also not entirely nonexistent, since the disturbed consciousness creates the appearances of the grasped and the grasper. “And so forth” refers to things such as mirages, dreams, and the [reflection of the] moon in water, which should be understood accordingly.
以能諦觀義如幻等，於有無品心不動散，如實知見此不動者，應知是於不動無倒。	The mind will remain undistracted with respect to categories of existence and nonexistence when clearly observing objects such as illusions, etc. One who accurately knows this immovability should understand that this is freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to immovability.
於二相無倒者，謂於自相及共相中俱無顛倒。	With respect to freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to twofold characteristics, it refers to being free from cognitive distortion in relation to Chapter Seven both the characteristic of being defined and the shared characteristic.
於自相無倒者，頌曰：   於自相無倒，   知一切唯名，   離一切分別，   依勝義自相。	With respect to freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to defining characteristic, the verse reads as follows: With respect to freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to defining characteristics, knowing that all things exist only by their being named, one is freed from all discrimination. This is based on the defining characteristics from the perspective of the supreme meaning.
論曰：如實知見一切眼色乃至意法皆唯有名，即能對治一切分別，應知是於自相無倒。	Commentary: Accurately cognizing that everything—from the eye to perceived forms, and consciousness to conceptualized phenomena—merely exist based on their being named corrects all discrimination; one should know this as freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to the defining characteristic.
此依勝義自相而說。	This is explained as the defining characteristic on the basis of supreme meaning.
若依世俗非但有名可取，種種差別相故。	In the case of being based on worldly conception, it is not only because things have names that one can grasp onto various distinct characteristics.
於共相無倒者，頌曰：   以離真法界，   無別有一法，   故通達此者，   於共相無倒。	With respect to freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to characteristic of being shared, the verse reads as follows: There is no separate single phenomenon existing apart from real experiential reality, hence one who has realized this is free from cognitive distortions with respect to common characteristics. Commentary:
論曰：以無一法離法無我者故，真法界諸法共相攝。	Phenomena (dharmas) of the real experiential reality (dharma dhātu) possess a common characteristic, since not a single phenomenon exists apart from the absence of self in phenomena.
如實知見此共相者，應知是於共相無倒。	One who accurately knows this characteristic of commonality should know that this is freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to the common characteristic. With respect to freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to defilement and purity.
於染淨無倒者，頌曰：   知顛倒作意，   未滅及已滅，   於法界雜染，   清淨無顛倒。	The verse reads as follows: Know erroneous intentions in relation to whether or not they have been eliminated. The absence of cognitive distortions [determines] defilement and purity in experiential reality.
論曰：若未斷滅顛倒作意，爾時法界說為雜染，已斷滅時說為清淨。	Commentary: When one has not yet eliminated erroneous intentions experiential reality is said to be defiled, whereas when they have been eliminated it is said to be pure.
如實知見此染淨者，如次是於染淨無倒。	One who accurately knows this defilement and purity subsequently becomes free of cognitive distortion in relation to defilement and purity.
於客無倒，其相云何？	What are the characteristics of freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to the adventitious?
頌曰：   知法界本性，   清淨如虛空，   故染淨非主，   是於客無倒。	The verse reads as follows: Know that the original nature of experiential reality is pure like empty space. Hence, defilement and purity are not fundamental. This is freedom from cognitive distortion with respect to the adventitious.
論曰：法界本性淨若虛空，由此應知先染後淨二差別相是客非主。	Commentary: The original nature of experiential reality is pure like empty space. Hence one should understand that the two differing characteristics of being previously defiled and later pure is adventitious and not fundamental.
如實知見此客相者，應知是名於客無倒。	One who accurately knows this adventitious characteristic should understand that this is freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to the adventitious.
於無怖無高俱無顛倒者，頌曰：   有情法無故，   染淨性俱無，   知此無怖高，   是於二無倒。	With respect to freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to the absence of both fear and arrogance, the verse reads as follows: Since beings and phenomena (dharmas) do not exist, the natures of defilement and purity are both nonexistent. Knowing this, one is free from fear and arrogance. This is freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to these two.
論曰：有情及法俱非有故，彼染淨性亦俱非有。	Commentary: Since beings and phenomena are both nonexistent, their natures as either defiled or pure are also both nonexistent.
以染淨義俱不可得，故染淨品無減無增，由此於中無怖無慢。	Since the meanings of both defilement and purity are untenable, their grades of defilement and purity are without inferiority and superiority. As a result of this there is neither fear nor arrogance.
如實知見無怖高者，應知是名於二無倒。	One who accurately knows this absence of fear and arrogance should understand that this is called freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to these two.
無倒行總義者，謂由文無倒，能正通達止觀二相；	Regarding the general meaning of activity free from cognitive distortion, one is able to correctly understand the two characteristics of meditative cessation and observation as a result of freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to syllables.
由義無倒，能正通達諸顛倒相；	One is able to correctly understand the characteristics of cognitive distortion as a result of freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to objects.
由作意無倒，於倒因緣能正遠離；	One is able to properly become freed from the causes and conditions relevant to cognitive distortion as a result of freedom from erroneous orientation [toward the lesser vehicles].
由不動無倒，善取彼相；	One skillfully grasps those Chapter Seven characteristics as a result of freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to being immovable.
由自相無倒，修彼對治無分別道；	One cultivates its antidote, the path of nondiscrimination, as a result of freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to the defining characteristic.
由共相無倒，能正通達本性清淨；	One correctly understands the purity of original nature as a result of freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to the common characteristic.
由染淨無倒，了知未斷及已斷障；	One knows which obstacles have yet to be or have already been eliminated as a result of freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to defilement and purity.
由客無倒，如實了知染淨二相；	One accurately knows the two characteristics of defilement and purity as a result of freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to the adventitious.
由無怖無高二種無倒，諸障斷滅得永出離。	Obstacles are eliminated and one attains permanent liberation as a result of freedom from cognitive distortion in relation to the absence of both fear and arrogance.
此十無倒如次安立於彼十種金剛句中。	These ten freedoms from cognitive distortion are respectively established in relation to the ten adamantine (vajra) phrases.
何等名為十金剛句？ 謂有非有無顛倒。	What are the ten adamantine phrases?
所依幻等喻無分別。 本性清淨雜染清淨。 虛空喻無減無增。	They are (1) existence and nonexistence, (2) freedom from cognitive distortion, (3) the basis, (4) the simile of the illusion, etc., (5) nondiscrimination, (6) the purity of original nature, (7) defilement and purity, (8) the simile of space, (9) the absence of decrease, and (10) the absence of increase.
為攝如是十金剛句，有二頌言：   「應知有非有，   無顛倒所依，   幻等無分別，   本性常清淨，   及雜染清淨，   性淨喻虛空，   無減亦無增，   是十金剛句。	There are two parts that encompass these ten adamantine phrases in this manner. The verses read as follows: One should understand (1) existence and nonexistence, (2) freedom from cognitive distortion, (3) the basis, (4) the similes of the illusion, etc., (5) nondiscrimination, and (6) the constant purity of original nature; as well as (7) defilement and purity, (8) space as a metaphor for purity, (9) the absence of decrease, and (10) the absence of increase. These are the ten adamantine phrases.
」且初安立十金剛句。 自性者，謂自性故、所緣故，無分別故、釋難故。	First, when establishing the ten adamantine phrases, reference is made to intrinsic nature, i.e., in terms of intrinsic nature, objective support, nondiscrimination, and refutation of objections.
自性故者，謂三自性，即圓成實、遍計所執及依他起。	“Intrinsic nature” refers to the three intrinsic natures, i.e., the perfectly accomplished, the conceptualized, and the other-dependent.
是初三句，如次應知。	The first three words should be understood respectively.
所緣故者，即三自性。	“Objective support” refers to the three intrinsic natures.
無分別故者，謂由此無分別，即無分別智； 及於此無分別，即本性清淨。	“Nondiscrimination” refers to nondiscrimination due to this, i.e., nondiscriminating wisdom, as well as nondiscrimination here, i.e., the purity of original nature.
如次應知安立境智，謂三自性及無分別。	The establishment of objects and cognition should be understood respectively, which refers to the three intrinsic natures and nondiscrimination.
釋難故者，謂所餘句。	“Refutation of objections” refers to the remaining phrases.
且有難言：遍計所執、依他起相，若實是無，云何可得？	There is a critique that if the characteristics of the conceptualized and the other-dependent are nonexistent in reality, how would they be apprehendable?
若實是有，不應諸法本性清淨。	If they are existent in reality then phenomena should not be pure in their original nature.
為釋此難，說幻等喻，如幻事等雖實是無而現可得。	In order to refute this criticism, the simile of an illusion and so forth are taught. For instance, although illusory things are nonexistent in reality, they can be seen.
復有難言：若一切法本性清淨，如何得有先染後淨？	There is a further critique that if all phenomena are pure in their original nature, how is it possible to have it that they are first defiled and subsequently purified?
為釋此難，說有染淨及虛空喻，謂如虛空雖本性淨，而有雜染及清淨時。	In order to refute this criticism defilement and purity are explained with reference to the simile of space, e.g., in the way that although space is originally pure there are times when it is defiled or pure.
復有難言：有無量佛出現於世，一一能度無量有情，令出生死入於涅槃。	There is a further critique that states that innumerable buddhas appear in the world, each being capable of liberating innumerable sentient beings, causing them to leave samsara and enter nirvana.
云何生死無斷滅失、涅槃界中無增益過？	What of the error [that suggests] no cessation of samsara and the fault [presuming that] within the state of nirvana there is no increase?
為釋此難，說染及淨無減無增。	In order to refute this criticism defilement and purity are explained with reference to the absence of decrease and increase.
又有情界及清淨品俱無量故。	It is also because the realms of beings and their grades of purity are both innumerable.
第二安立彼自性者，如有頌言：   「亂境自性因，   無亂自性境，   亂無亂二果，   及彼二邊際。	Second, with respect to establishing their intrinsic natures. The verse reads as follows: The object, intrinsic nature and cause of confusion; the intrinsic nature and object of non-error; the two results of error and non-error; and their two extremes.
」如是已說隨法正行。 離二邊正行云何應知？	Having already explained correct practice in conformity with the true Dharma in this manner, how is correct practice free from the two extremes to be understood?
如《寶積經》所說中道行。	It is like the practice of the Middle Way as taught in the Ratnakūṭa-sūtra.
此行遠離何等二邊？ 頌曰：   異性與一性，   外道及聲聞，   增益損減邊，   有情法各二。	What are the two extremes that this practice distantly avoids? The verses read as follows:
所治及能治，   常住與斷滅，   所取能取邊，   染淨二三種。	Chapter Seven Variant nature and same nature; the heterodox (non-Buddhists) and śrāvakas; the extreme views of reification and negation are each twofold with respect to sentient beings and phenomena; that which is corrected and the antidote; permanence and annihilationism; the extreme views of grasped and grasper and defilement and purity, [these] two being of three types; one should understand the additional seven types of discrimination with respect to the natures of dual extremes:
分別二邊性，   應知復有七，   謂有非有邊，   所能寂怖畏，   所能取正邪，   有用并無用，   不起及時等，   是分別二邊。	(1) the extremes of existence and nonexistence, (2) the calmed and the act of calming, (3) the feared and the fear produced from it, (4) grasped and grasper, (5) correctness and error, (6) activity and nonactivity, (7) nonarising and simultaneity. These are the two extremes of discrimination.
論曰：若於色等執我有異、或執是一，名為一邊；	Commentary: If self is grasped as different from form, etc., or it is grasped as identical [to form, etc.], these are respectively called individual extreme views.
為離此執說中道行，謂觀無我乃至儒童，見有我者定起此執，我異於身、或即身故。	The practice of the Middle Way is taught in order to free one from this grasping, meaning that when contemplating not-self up to and including the youth, one who perceives a self will definitely give rise to this grasping, since the self is either different from the body or is the body.20 The heterodox extreme view is grasping to form, etc., as permanently abiding.
若於色等執為常住是外道邊，執無常者是聲聞邊；	Grasping to impermanence is an extreme view of the śrāvakas.
為離此執說中道行，謂觀色等非常無常。	The practice of the Middle Way is taught to [allow the practitioner to] be freed from these kinds of grasping, meaning that when contemplating form, etc. there is neither permanence nor impermanence.
定執有我是增益有情邊，定執無我是損減有情邊，彼亦撥無假有情故；	Firmly grasping to the existence of self is the extreme view in which sentient beings are reified. Firmly grasping to the nonexistence of self is the extreme view in which beings are denied, even their nominal existence.
為離此執說中道行，謂我無我二邊中智。	The practice of the Middle Way is taught in order to free one from this grasping, which is awareness of the middle between the two extreme views of self and not-self.
定執心有實是增益法邊，定執心無實是損減法邊；	Firmly grasping to the mind as being real is the extreme view in which phenomena are reified. Firmly grasping to the mind as being unreal is the extreme view in which phenomena are denied.
為離此執說中道行，謂於是處無心無思無意無識。	The practice of the Middle Way is taught to free the practitioner from this grasping, which means that there is no mind, volition, thought, or consciousness.
執有不善等諸雜染法是所治邊，執有善等諸清淨法是能治邊；	Grasping to the existence of defiled phenomena such as unwholesomeness and so forth is the extreme view regarding that which is corrected. Grasping to the existence of wholesome and other pure phenomena is the extreme view regarding antidotes.
為離此執說中道行，謂於二邊不隨觀說。	The practice of the Middle Way is taught in order to free one from this grasping, meaning there is no following, contemplation, or discussion of the two extremes.
於有情法定執為有是常住邊，定執非有是斷滅邊；	Firmly grasping to the phenomena of sentient beings as existent is the extreme view of permanence. Firmly grasping them as nonexistent is the extreme view of annihilationism.
為離此執說中道行，謂即於此二邊中智。	The practice of the Middle Way is taught to be freed from this grasping, meaning that this is the awareness between the two extreme views.
執有無明所取能取各為一邊，若執有明所取能取各為一邊。	With respect to grasping to the existence of ignorance, the grasped and the grasper each constitute one extreme view. With respect to grasping to the existence of knowledge, the grasped and the grasper each constitute one extreme view.
如是執有所治諸行、能治無為，乃至老死及能滅彼諸對治道所取能取各為一邊。	In this manner, grasping to the existence of the mental formations to be corrected and the unconditioned that corrects—up to old age and death—as well as the corrective paths that can eliminate those as consisting of something grasped and a grasper, each respectively constitutes an extreme view.
此所能治所取能取，即是黑品白品差別。	Here that which is corrected and the antidote, and grasped and grasper, are differentiated into black and white parts.
為離此執說中道行，謂明與無明無二無二分，乃至廣說，明無明等所取能取皆非有故。	The practice of the Middle Way is taught in order to free one from this grasping, meaning that knowledge and ignorance are explained to be nondual, undivided, and so forth, since knowledge and ignorance, etc. with respect to the grasped and the grasper, are all nonexistent.
雜染有三，謂煩惱雜染、業雜染、生雜染。	Defilement comprises three types: the defilements of afflictions, the defilements of karma, and the defilements of birth.
煩惱雜染復有三種：一諸見、二貪瞋癡相、三後有願。	The defilements of afflictions further comprise three types: (1) views; (2) the characteristics of craving, anger, and ignorance; (3) the wish for rebirth.
此能對治，謂空智、無相智、無願智。	The antidotes for these are knowledge of emptiness, knowledge of signlessness, and knowledge of wishlessness.
業雜染，謂所作善惡業。	Defilements of karma refer to wholesome and unwholesome actions that are carried out.
此能對治，謂不作智。	The antidote for these is knowledge of nonaction (i.e., not forming new karma).
生雜染有三種：一後有生、二生已心心所念念起、三後有相續。	Defilements of birth comprise three types: (1) rebirth, (2) successive arising of the mind and mental factors once reborn, (3) the continuity of rebirth.
此能對治，謂無生智、無起智、無自性智。	The antidotes for these are knowledge of the birthless, knowledge of nonarising, and knowledge of the absence of intrinsic nature [across lifetimes].
如是三種雜染除滅，說為清淨。	Chapter Seven In this manner, the elimination of the three types of defilements is called purity.
空等智境，謂空等法。	The sphere of cognition as it relates to emptiness and so forth refers to dharmas such as emptiness.
三種雜染隨其所應，非空等智令作空等，由彼本性是空性等，法界本來性無染故。	The three types of defilements accordingly are not made empty by the knowledge of emptiness, etc. The original nature of experiential reality is without defilement, since its original nature is emptiness, etc.
若於法界或執雜染或執清淨各為一邊，本性無染，非染淨故。	Grasping to defilement or grasping to purity in relation to experiential reality each constitute an extreme view, since their original nature is without defilement and is neither defiled nor pure.
為離此執說中道行，謂不由空能空於法，法性自空，乃至廣說。	The practice of the Middle Way is taught to be freed from this grasping, meaning that it is not a result of emptiness that phenomena are made to be empty, as the nature of phenomena is in itself emptiness.
復有七種分別二邊。	Furthermore, there are seven types of discrimination between dual extremes.
何等為七？	What are the seven?
謂分別有、分別非有各為一邊。	(1) Discriminating existence and discriminating nonexistence each constitute one extreme.
彼執實有補特伽羅以為壞滅，立空性故。 或於無我分別為無為。	These are due to grasping to a real existence of a pudgala (person), believing that it must be destroyed to establish emptiness, or other wise discriminating not-self as unconditioned.
離如是二邊分別說中道行，謂不為滅補特伽羅方立空性，然彼空性本性自空，前際亦空、後際亦空、中際亦空，乃至廣說。	The practice of the Middle Way is taught to free from this sort of discrimination of dual extremes, meaning that emptiness is not established in order to reject the [the notion of] pudgala. The original nature of that emptiness, however, is itself empty; it was also empty in the past, will also be empty in the future, and is also empty in the present.
分別所寂、分別能寂各為一邊。 執有所斷及有能斷，怖畏空故。	(2) Discrimination of something silenced and the act of silencing each constitute an extreme view, since grasping to the existence of something severed and the act of severance is due to fear of emptiness.
為離如是二邊分別，說虛空喻。	The simile of space is taught in order to free one from this sort of differentiation of dual extremes.
分別所怖、分別從彼所生可畏各為一邊。 執有遍計所執色等可生怖故，執有從彼所生苦法可生畏故。	(3) Discrimination of the fearsome and discrimination of fear produced from that each constitute an extreme view, because grasping to the existence of conceptualized forms and so forth can produce fear, and because grasping to the existence of painful phenomena produced from that can produce terror.
為離如是二邊分別，說畫師喻。	The simile of the painter [who was frightened by his own painting] is taught in order to free one from this sort of differentiation of dual extremes.
前虛空喻為聲聞說，今畫師喻為菩薩說。	The former simile of space is taught for śrāvakas. The present simile of the painter is taught for bodhisattvas.
分別所取、分別能取各為一邊。	(4) Discrimination of something grasped and the act of grasping each constitute an extreme view.
為離如是二邊分別，說幻師喻。	The simile of the illusionist is taught in order to free one from this sort of differentiation of dual extremes.
由唯識智無境智生，由無境智生復捨唯識。	Cognition of the nonexistence of object arises due to cognition of consciousness only, and [cognition of] consciousness only is furthermore abandoned due to arising of cognition of the nonexistence of object.
智境既非有，識亦是無，要託所緣識方生故。	Since the cognized object is nonexistent consciousness will also not be existent, since consciousness arises dependent upon the objective support.
由斯所喻與喻同法。	Hence, that to which the simile refers and the simile itself demonstrate similar properties (i.e., the simile properly applies to the actual situation).
分別正性、分別邪性各為一邊。 執如實觀為正為邪，二種性故。	(5) Discrimination of correct nature and discrimination of mistaken nature each constitute an extreme view, since grasping to accurate observation of what is real as either correct or incorrect constitute two types of natures.
為離如是二邊分別，說兩木生火喻。 謂如兩木雖無火相，由相鑽截而能生火，火既生已還燒兩木。	The simile of two pieces of wood producing fire is taught in order to be free from this sort of discrimination of dual extremes, meaning that although the two pieces of wood do not possess the characteristic of fire, by rubbing them together one can produce fire. Having produced fire, it comes to burn both pieces of wood.
此如實觀亦復如是，雖無聖道正性之相，而能發生正性聖慧。 如是正性聖慧生已，復能除遣此如實觀。	This accurate observation is also furthermore like this. Although there is no characteristic of correctness in the noble path it is possible to produce the noble wisdom of correctness; noble wisdom of correctness having been produced in this fashion, it furthermore can do away with this sort of accurate observation.
由斯所喻與喻同法。	Hence, that to which the simile refers and the simile itself demonstrate similar properties.
然如實觀雖無正性相，順正性故亦無邪性相。	With respect to accurate observation, however, although there is no characteristic of correctness, since it is in conformity with correctness there is also no characteristic of falsity.
分別有用、分別無用各為一邊。	(6) Discrimination of activity and nonactivity each constitute an extreme view.
彼執聖智要先分別方能除染，或全無用。	They grasp unto the notion that noble wisdom must first discriminate before it is possible to remove defilements, otherwise they are entirely without activity.
為離如是二邊分別，說初燈喻。	The simile of the first lamp is taught in order to free one from this sort of differentiation of dual extremes.
分別不起、分別時等各為一邊。	(7) Discrimination of nonarising and simultaneity each constitute an extreme view.
彼執能治畢竟不起，或執與染應等時長。	They grasp unto the notion that the antidote ultimately does not arise, or that grasping and defilement should persist for the same length of time.
為離如是二邊分別，說後燈喻。	The simile of the subsequent lamp is taught in order to free one from this sort of differentiation of dual extremes.
如是已說離二邊正行差別。 無差別正行云何？	Chapter Seven Having explained correct practice free from the two extremes, what is correct practice with and without differences?
頌曰：   差別無差別，   應知於十地，   十波羅蜜多，   增上等修集。	The verse reads as follows: Differentiated and undifferentiated should be understood in relation to the ten grounds. The ten perfections [relate to] predomination and equal cultivation.
論曰：於十地中十到彼岸隨一增上而修集者，應知說為差別正行。	Commentary: Each of the ten perfections predominates over one of the ten grounds respectively. One should understand that [when one is] being cultivated, this is called correct practice with differences (i.e., distinct).
於一切地皆等修集布施等十波羅蜜多，如是正行名無差別。	On all the grounds, when everything has been equally cultivated, i.e., the ten perfections such as generosity, etc., this sort of correct practice is called without differences (i.e., indistinct).
六正行總義者，謂即如是品類最勝，由此思惟如所施設大乘法等，由如是品無亂轉變修奢摩他，及無倒轉變修毘鉢舍那，為如是義修中道行而求出離，於十地中修習差別無差別行。	The general meaning of the six types of correct practice [is as follows]: (1) the supreme of such categories [supreme correct practice], (2) the resulting contemplation of the established Mahayana Dharma and so forth [correct practice via mental orientation], (3) resulting from cultivation of śamatha aimed at such classes of unconfused development, and cultivation of vipaśyanā aimed at development free from cognitive distortion [correct practice in conformity with the Dharma], (4) cultivation of the practice of the Middle Way and seeking liberation with such an aim [correct practice that is free from the two extreme views], and on the ten grounds (6) cultivation with differences and (7) practice without differences.
如是已說正行無上。 所緣無上其相云何？	Having explained the unexcelled with respect to correct practice, what are the characteristics of the unexcelled with respect to its objective support? The verse reads as follows: The objective supports for:
頌曰：   所緣謂安、界、   所能立、任持、   印內持、通達，   增、證、運、最勝。	(1) establishing designations, (2) experiential reality, (3) what is established, (4) establishing, (5) retention, (6) ascertainment, (7) preservation, (8) penetration, (9) development, (10) realization, (11) mental equanimity, and (12) the supreme. Commentary:
論曰：如是所緣有十二種，一安立法施設所緣、二法界所緣、三所立所緣、四能立所緣、五任持所緣、六印持所緣、七內持所緣、八通達所緣、九增長所緣、十分證所緣、十一等運所緣、十二最勝所緣。	There are twelve types of such objective support: (1) objective support for establishing the designations of phenomena, (2) objective support that is experiential reality, (3) objective support of what is established, (4) objective support for establishing, (5) objective support for retention, (6) objective support for ascertainment, (7) objective support for preservation, (8) objective support for penetration, (9) objective support fordevelopment, (10) objective support for partial realization, (11) objective support for meditative equanimity, (12) supreme objective support.
此中最初謂所安立到彼岸等差別法門；	Herein the first refers to what is established, referring to the differing Dharma practices of the respective perfections.
第二謂真如；	The second refers to thusness.
第三第四如次應知，即前二種到彼岸等差別法門，要由通達法界成故；	The third and fourth should be understood in order, meaning that these latter two types of differentiated Dharma practices related to the perfections must be attained via penetration into experiential reality.
第五謂聞所成慧境，任持文故；	The fifth refers to objects of knowledge comprised from what is heard, since there is retention of words.
第六謂思所成慧境，印持義故；	The sixth refers to objects of knowledge comprised from thought, since there is ascertainment of meaning.
第七謂修所成慧境，內別持故；	The seventh refers to objects of knowledge comprised from [meditative] cultivation, since there is individual preservation.
第八謂初地中見道境；	The eighth refers to the objects of the path of seeing on the first ground.
