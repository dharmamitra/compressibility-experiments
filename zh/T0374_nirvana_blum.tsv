大般涅槃經卷第一北涼天竺三藏曇無讖譯壽命品第
一如是我聞：	Thus have I heard.
一時佛在拘尸那國力士生地阿利羅跋提河邊娑羅雙樹間。 爾時世尊與大比丘八十億百千人俱，前後圍遶。	At one time the Buddha was between a pair of sal trees by the banks of the Ajiravati River in Kusinagara, the native land of the Malla people. At that time the World-Honored One was together with monks numbering what seemed like eight trillion and surrounding him on all sides.
二月十五日臨涅槃時，以佛神力出大音聲，其聲遍滿乃至有頂，隨其類音普告眾生：	It was the fifteenth day of the second month, and he was about to pass into nirvana. Using his supernatural powers, the Buddha spoke out in a great voice so loud that it filled the world, reaching even to the highest heaven in the triple world. Projecting a variety of sounds, he spoke to living beings in every quarter, saying:
「今日如來、應、正遍知，憐愍眾生，覆護眾生，等視眾生如羅睺羅，為作歸依屋舍室宅。	Today, the Tathagata, the One Worthy of Offerings, the Perfectly Enlightened One, is filled with compassion toward living beings, protects living beings, and looks equally upon [all] living beings as if he were looking upon his own son Rahula. He creates rooms and houses of refuge for them.
大覺世尊將欲涅槃，一切眾生若有所疑，今悉可問，為最後問。」	The World-Honored One of the great enlightenment is about to enter nirvana. If there is anyone among you with doubts [regarding the teachings], you should ask your questions now, as this will be your last opportunity for questions.
爾時世尊於晨朝時，從其面門放種種光，其明雜色，青、黃、赤、白、頗梨、馬瑙，光遍照此三千大千佛之世界，乃至十方亦復如是。	At that time, in the early morning, the World-Honored One emitted from his mouth a variety of rays of light. This light was multicolored: blue, yellow, red, white, crystal, and emerald, and it shone throughout the three thousand-great thousand buddha worlds, reaching similarly into all ten directions.
其中所有六趣眾生遇斯光者，罪垢煩惱一切消除。	Living beings in all six realms that encountered it had their transgressions, impurities, and defilements eliminated entirely.
是諸眾生見聞是已，心大憂愁，同時舉聲悲啼號哭：「嗚呼慈父，痛哉苦哉。」	 Those who saw and heard these things felt great sorrow. Simultaneously they raised their voices in a doleful cry: Compassionate father! How distressing, how awful this is!
舉手拍頭搥胸叫喚，其中或有身體戰慄、涕泣、哽咽。	Some raised their hands in the air, slapped their foreheads, pounded their chests, and screamed. Others felt their bodies tremble, some cried, and others were choked with tears.
爾時大地諸山大海，皆悉震動，時諸眾生共相謂言：「且各裁抑，莫大愁苦。	At that time the earth, mountains, and great oceans all began shaking. The people said to each other: For the time being, let us restrain ourselves and not grieve so.
當疾往詣拘尸那城力士生處，至如來所，頭面禮敬，勸請如來莫般涅槃，住世一劫若減一劫。」	Rather, we should go quickly to Kusinagara, the land of the Mallas, and upon reaching the Tathagata, bow our heads in respect and beseech him, saying, Tathagata! Please do not pass over into parinirvana! Stay in the world for one more kalpa, at least something close to a kalpa.
互相執手復作是言：「世間空虛，眾生福盡，不善諸業，增長出世。	They joined hands and exclaimed: The world will become empty, living beings will find their blessings depleted and impure karma will only increase.
仁等今當速往速往，如來不久必入涅槃。」	Everyone, let us go quickly, quickly! The Tathagata will surely enter nirvana before long.
復作是言：「世間空虛，世間空虛，我等從今無有救護，無所宗仰，貧窮孤露。	 They said this as well: The world is empty, the world is empty! From now on we will have no one to rescue us, no one to honor. We will be destitute and defenseless.
一旦遠離無上世尊，設有疑惑當復問誰？」	Once the peerless World-Honored One is gone, to whom will we direct our questions should doubts arise?
時有無量諸大弟子，尊者摩訶迦旃延、尊者薄俱羅、尊者優波難陀，如是等諸大比丘，遇佛光者，其身戰掉，乃至大動不能自持，心濁迷悶，發聲大喚，生如是等種種苦惱。	At that time there were innumerable great disciples [of the Buddha] present, including Venerable Mahakatyana, Venerable Vakkula, and Venerable Upananda. When they encountered the radiance of the Buddha, the bodies of these great bhiksus began to quiver until they were seized by an uncontrollable shaking. Their minds grew turbid, they became disoriented, and they raised their voices in a loud cry. They were stricken with a variety of troubles like this.
爾時復有八十百千諸比丘等，皆阿羅漢，心得自在，所作已辦，離諸煩惱，調伏諸根，如大龍王有大威德，	At the time eight million monks were also assembled, and all were arhats. Their minds were freed, their tasks were accomplished, they were free of the defilements, and they had tamed their cognitive senses. Like the great dragon kings, they possessed great spiritual power.
成就空慧，逮得己利，如栴檀林栴檀圍遶，如師子王師子圍遶，成就如是無量功德，一切皆是佛之真子。	Accomplished in the wisdom of emptiness (sunyata), what they had gained personally was akin to a sandalwood grove with rows of sandalwood trees in every direction; they were like lion kings surrounded by prides of lions. Thus it can be said that these monks had achieved an incalculable amount of merit and virtue, and every one of them was a true child of the Buddha.
於其晨朝，日始初出，離常住處，嚼楊枝時，遇佛光明，并相謂言：「仁等，速疾漱口澡手。」	As the sun began to rise in the early morning sky, the monks emerged from their lodgings and were cleaning their teeth when they came upon the Buddha's light. They said to each other, Quickly, rinse your mouths and wash your hands!
作是言已，舉身毛竪，遍體血現如波羅奢花，涕泣盈目生大苦惱。	After this exchange, their hair stood on end all over their bodies, and their blood flowed so strongly that they looked like the [scarlet] palasa flower. Tears filled their eyes and they felt great discomfort.
為欲利益安樂眾生，成就大乘第一空行，顯發如來方便密教，為不斷絕種種說法，為諸眾生調伏因緣故，疾至佛所稽首佛足，繞百千匝，合掌恭敬，却坐一面。	Wanting to give blessings and peace of mind to living beings, to accomplish the primary Mahayana practice of emptiness, to reveal the recondite teaching that is the Tathagata's skillful means, to prevent the extinction of his sermons, and to provide causes and conditions for living beings to discipline themselves, the monks rushed to where the Buddha was and bowed down at his feet. Circumambulating him one hundred thousand times, they then placed their palms together in reverence, withdrew, and sat at one side.
爾時復有拘陀羅女、善賢比丘尼、優波難陀比丘尼、海意比丘尼，與六十億比丘尼等，一切亦是大阿羅漢，諸漏已盡，心得自在，所作已辦，離諸煩惱，調伏諸根，猶如大龍有大威德，成就空慧。	At that time from among the Kudala women, Subhadra, Upananda, Sagaramati, and six billion other nuns were present. All of them were also great arhats: their contaminants were exhausted, their minds were freed, their tasks were accomplished, they were free of the defilements, and they had tamed their cognitive senses. They were like huge dragons in possessing great spiritual power, and were accomplished in the wisdom of emptiness.
亦於晨朝，日初出時，舉身毛竪，遍體血現如波羅奢花，涕泣盈目生大苦惱。	Just like [the monks], when the sun began to rise in the early morning, the hair of these nuns stood on end all over their bodies and their blood flowed so strongly that they looked like the palasa flower. Tears filled their eyes and they felt great discomfort.
亦欲利益安樂眾生，成就大乘第一空行，顯發如來方便密教，為不斷絕種種說法，為諸眾生調伏因緣故，疾至佛所稽首佛足，遶百千匝，合掌恭敬，却坐一面。	Wanting to give blessings and peace of mind to living beings, to accomplish the primary Mahayana practice of emptiness, to reveal the hidden teaching that is the Tathagata's skillful means, to prevent the extinction of his sermons, and to provide causes and conditions for living beings to discipline themselves, they rushed to where the Buddha was and bowed down at his feet. Circumambulating him one hundred thousand times, they then placed their palms together in reverence, withdrew, and sat at one side.
於比丘尼眾中復有諸比丘尼，皆是菩薩，人中之龍，位階十地安住不動，為化眾生現受女身，而常修集四無量心，得自在力，能化作佛。	In this gathering of nuns, they were all bodhisattvas, dragons among the people, for in rank they were firmly settled within the ten stages (dasabhumi) from which they could not be moved. Having taken on female bodies in order to spiritually transform living beings, they were constantly cultivating the four immeasurable minds and had attained positions where b they were freely able to attain buddhahood.
爾時復有一恒河沙菩薩摩訶薩，人中之龍，位階十地安住不動，方便現身。	Also at that time there were bodhisattva-mahasattvas as numerous as grains of sand in the Ganges River. They, too, were dragons among the people, and in rank they were firmly settled within the ten stages from which they could not be moved.
其名曰：海德菩薩、無盡意菩薩，如是等菩薩摩訶薩而為上首。	Through their power of using expedient means, they manifested themselves in their present bodies with names such as the bodhisattva Oceanlike Virtue (Samudradatta) and the bodhisattva Imperishable Resolve. Such bodhisattva-mahasattvas as these led this group. Their thoughts were filled with reverence for the Mahayana:
其心皆悉敬重大乘，安住大乘，深解大乘，愛樂大乘，守護大乘，善能隨順一切世間，作是誓言：「諸未度者，當令得度。」	they were firmly settled in the Mahayana, they deeply appreciated the Mahayana, they longed for the Mahayana, and they were unwaveringly devoted to the Mahayana. In skillfully adapting to the ways of the whole world, each made the following pledge: I will enable all those who have not yet reached the other shore to do so.
已於過世無數劫中，修持淨戒，善持所行，解未解者，紹三寶種使不斷絕，於未來世當轉法輪，以大莊嚴而自莊嚴，成就如是無量功德，等觀眾生如視一子。	Throughout innumerable past kalpas, I have upheld the pure precepts, maintained well the practices, and liberated those who had not yet been liberated, [thereby] binding together the Three Jewels to prevent their dissolution. In the future I shall turn the wheel of the dharma, enhance it myself with great adornments, achieving innumerable merits. I will look upon all living beings equally, regarding them all as if they were my only child.
亦於晨朝，日初出時遇佛光明，舉身毛竪，遍體血現如波羅奢花，涕泣盈目生大苦惱。	When the sun began to rise early in the morning on that day, they likewise encountered the Buddha's radiance. Their hair stood on end all over their bodies, and their blood flowed so strongly that they looked like the palasa flower. Tears filled their eyes and they felt great discomfort.
亦為利益安樂眾生，成就大乘第一空行，顯發如來方便密教，為不斷絕種種說法，為諸眾生調伏因緣故，疾至佛所稽首佛足，繞百千匝，合掌恭敬，却坐一面。	Wanting to give benefits and peace of mind to living beings, to accomplish the primary Mahayana practice of emptiness, to reveal the hidden teaching that is the Tathagata's skillful means, to prevent the extinction of his sermons, and to provide causes and conditions for living beings to discipline themselves, they rushed to where the Buddha was and bowed down at his feet. Circumambulating him one hundred thousand times, they then placed their palms together in reverence, withdrew, and sat at one side. At that time male lay followers (upasakas) as numerous as the sands of two Ganges Rivers were also present. They upheld the five precepts (pancasila) and their conduct was impeccable.
爾時復有二恒河沙諸優婆塞，受持五戒，威儀具足，其名曰：威德無垢稱王優婆塞、善德優婆塞等而為上首，深樂觀察諸對治門，所謂苦樂、常無常、淨不淨、我無我、實不實、歸依非歸依、眾生非眾生、恒非恒、安非安、為無為、斷不斷、涅槃非涅槃、增上非增上，常樂觀察如是等法對治之門，亦欲樂聞無上大乘，如所聞已，能為他說。	Among them were the upasaka King Tejovimalakirti and the upasaka Pradanasara, who served as leaders. They came with keen anticipation to observe methods that would serve to resolve problems for them. That is, they were concerned about pleasure and pain, permanence and impermanence, purity and impurity, self and nons elf, real and unreal, taking refuge and not taking refuge, living beings and nonliving beings, eternal and noneternal, calmed and not calmed, created and uncreated, relinquished and not relinquished, nirvana and nonnirvana, and superlative and nonsuperlative. They constantly sought to observe the gate containing the curative effect of dharmas like these, and they wanted to partake in hearing the unsurpassed Mahayana and to be able to explain what they had heard to others.
善持淨戒，渴仰大乘，既自充足，復能充足餘渴仰者。	They skillfully kept the pure precepts and were exhilarated by the Mahayana. Having achieved satisfaction themselves, they sought to satisfy the aspirations of others in this way as well.
善能攝取無上智慧，愛樂大乘，守護大乘。	They were proficient in encompassing the unsurpassed spiritual wisdom of prajna.
善能隨順一切世間，度未度者，解未解者。	They longed for the Mahayana, were unwaveringly devoted to the Mahayana, and skillfully adapted to the ways of the whole world in ferrying over those who had not yet reached the other shore, liberating those who had not yet been liberated, and binding together the Three Jewels to prevent their dissolution.
紹三寶種使不斷絕，於未來世當轉法輪，以大莊嚴而自莊嚴，心常深味清淨戒行，悉能成就如是功德，於諸眾生生大悲心，平等無二如視一子。	In the future they will tum the wheel of the dharma and enhance it themselves with great adornments. They will always be deeply absorbed in savoring the moral practice of the pure precepts, and they will all achieve merit in this way. Their thoughts will be filled with great compassion toward all living beings equally and without discrimination, regarding them as one would look upon one's only child.
亦於晨朝日初出時，為欲闍毘如來身故，人人各取香木萬束、栴檀沈水、牛頭栴檀、天木香等，是一一木，文理及附，皆有七寶微妙光明，譬如種種雜彩畫飾，以佛力故有是妙色，青黃赤白，為諸眾生之所樂見。	When the sun began to rise in the early morning, each person gathered bundles of fragrant woods, such as brown sandalwood, agarwood, oxhead sandalwood, and other natural woods and fragrances, for the cremation of the Tathagata's body. The carvings, rough and fine, as well as the natural bark of the wood, all shone with the wondrous light of seven jewels. By the power of the Buddha, they were like an array of multicolored paintings that held an array of marvelous colors in blues, yellows, reds, and whites, to the visual delight of living beings.
諸木皆以種種香塗，欝金沈水及膠香等，散以諸花而為莊嚴，優鉢羅花、拘物頭花、波頭摩花、分陀利花。	The pieces of wood all had various fragrant coatings of saffron, aloe, sal resin, and so forth. Flowers were strewn to adorn [this collection], including the utpala (blue lotus), kumuda (yellow lotus), padma (red lotus), and pundarika (white lotus).
諸香木上懸五色幡，柔軟微妙猶如天衣，憍奢耶衣芻摩繒綵。	And above these fragrant woods were hung five-colored banderoles made of a soft, sheer fabric like that used by the gods, kauseya silk, or multicolor brocades woven with linen.
是諸香木載以寶車，是諸寶車出種種光，青黃赤白。	The fragrant wood was placed on jeweled carts that gave off either blue, yellow, red, or white light.
轅[車鬲]皆以七寶廁填，是一一車駕以四馬，是一一馬駿疾如風。	The wheel shafts were all inlaid with seven jewels as well; each cart had four horses attached t o it, and each o f these horses ran a s fast as the wind.
一一車前竪立五十七寶妙幢，真金羅網彌覆其上，	On the front of each cart were erected fifty-seven jeweled banderoles with nets woven of pure gold thrown over them.
一一寶車復有五十微妙寶蓋，一一車上垂諸花鬘，優鉢羅花、拘物頭花、波頭摩花、分陀利花，其花純以真金為葉，金剛為臺。	Each jeweled cart also had fifty lovely jeweled umbrellas, and from the top of each cart were hung flowered garlands of blue, yellow, red, and white lotus blossoms. These flowers were uniformly made up of pure gold leaves and diamond calyxes, and numerous black bees frolicked among these calyxes, amusing themselves.
是花臺中多有黑蜂，遊集其中歡娛受樂，又出妙音，所謂無常、苦、空、無我，是音聲中，復說菩薩本所行道。	In the process, the bees emitted a wonderful sound that intoned [the teachings of] impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and nonself, and the sound also expounded events from past [lives] in the career of the Bodhisattva.
復有種種歌舞伎樂、箏笛、箜篌、簫瑟、鼓吹，是樂音中復出是言：「苦哉，苦哉，世間空虛。」	In addition there was an assortment of song and dance performances and the playing of zithers, bamboo flutes, horizontal harps, bamboo panpipes, grand zithers, hand drums, and wind instruments. Included within this music were the words Dreadful, positively dreadful! The world is hollow.
一一車前，有優婆塞擎四寶案，是諸案上有種種花，優鉢羅花、拘物頭花、波頭摩花、分陀利花，欝金諸香及餘薰香，微妙第一。	 Before each cart lay followers held up four jeweled stands, all of which were covered with blue, yellow, red, and white lotus blossoms, as well as saffron and other perfumes, ideal in their subtle fragrance.
諸優婆塞為佛及僧，辦諸食具，種種備足，皆是栴檀沈水香薪，八功德水之所成熟，其食甘美有六種味：一苦、二醋、三甘、四辛、五醎、六淡。	These laymen took care of all necessary arrangements to provide meals for the Buddha and the sangha. All used fragrant sandalwood and agarwood for fuel and cooked with water that had each of the eight ideal qualities. The food was delicious, containing the six flavors of bitter, sour, sweet, spicy, salty, and plain.
復有三德：一者輕軟、二者淨潔、三者如法，作如是等種種莊嚴。	 The food also had three other qualities: it was tender, it was pure, and it accorded with the dharma.
至力士生處娑羅雙樹間，復以金沙遍布其地，以加陵伽衣、欽婆羅衣及繒綵衣而覆沙上，周匝遍滿十二由旬。	Having put together these various adornments, the laymen arrived at a grove of sal trees in the land of the Malla clan. There they went on to spread gold dust on the ground, and then covered the gold dust with cloth made of kalinga yarn, kambala yarn, and yarn-dyed silks. The area covered in this way reached fully twelve yojanas in size.
為佛及僧敷置七寶師子之座，其座高大如須彌山，是諸座上皆有寶帳，垂諸瓔珞。	There they constructed seven-jeweled lion seats for the Buddha and the sangha. These seats towered in the air like Mount Sumeru and were decorated by hanging jeweled curtains on all sides.
諸娑羅樹，悉懸種種微妙幡蓋，種種好香以塗樹身，種種名花以散樹間。	And from the many sal trees were also hung an assortment of fabulous banderoles and coverings. A variety of fragrant scents were smeared on the trunks of those trees and brightly colored flowers strewn on the ground between them.
諸優婆塞各作是念：「一切眾生若有所乏，須食與食、須飲與飲、須頭與頭、須目與目，隨諸眾生所須之物，皆悉給與。」	Each of the upasakas present had these thoughts : If there are any among these living beings who are impoverished, I can help them. To those who seek food I shall give them food, to those who seek drink I shall give them drink, to those who seek [the ability to use their] heads I shall give them [intelligence in their] heads, to those who seek [the ability to use their] eyes I shall give them [insight through their] eyes. Whatever these living beings need shall be provided.
作是施時，離欲瞋恚、穢濁毒心，無餘思惟求世福樂，唯期無上清淨菩提。	For when I give in this way I free myself from any defiled, poisonous thoughts of greed or enmity. Any lingering thoughts of mine that yearn for worldly happiness or personal comfort disappear, and I am left with naught but an expectation of pure bodhi (religious awakening).
是優婆塞等，皆已安住於菩薩道，復作是念：「如來今者受我食已，當入涅槃。」	All these male lay followers were well established in the bodhisattva path. Then they thought, After the Tathagata accepts our meal, he will enter nirvana. But upon thinking this, their hair stood on end all over their bodies and their blood flowed so strongly they looked like palasa flowers. Tears filled their eyes and they became very upset. Now each of these people carried the materials for their offerings. On jeweled carts they loaded fragrant woods, banderoles, banners, jeweled umbrellas, and food and drink.
作是念已，身毛皆竪，遍體血現如波羅奢花，涕泣盈目生大苦惱，各各齎持供養之具，載以寶車、香木、幢幡、寶蓋、飲食，疾至佛所稽首佛足，以其所持供養之具，供養如來，遶百千匝，舉聲號泣，哀動天地，	They then hurried to where the Buddha was and bowed down at his feet. With the preparations they had brought, they thereupon made formal offerings to the Tathagata and made circumambulations around him one hundred thousand times, raising their voices in such a sorrowful wail that heaven and earth were moved.
搥胸大叫，淚下如雨，復相謂言：「苦哉，仁者！世間空虛，世間空虛。」	They pounded their chests, letting out a roar, their tears falling like rain. And they said to each other, Listen, this is dreadful! The world is hollow, the world is hollow!
便自舉身，投如來前，而白佛言：「唯願如來，哀受我等最後供養。 」世尊知時默然不受。	They then threw themselves before the Tathagata, and blurted out: All we ask, Tathagata, is that you have pity on us and accept our final offerings. The World-Honored One, understanding the occasion, remained silent and did not accept their offerings.
如是三請，悉皆不許。	They beseeched him in the same way three times, but each time they were all refused.
諸優婆塞不果所願，心懷悲惱，默然而住。	Their wishes unfulfilled, the laymen felt dejected and anxious, remaining in silence.
猶如慈父唯有一子，卒病喪亡，送其屍骸置於塚間，歸還悵悢，愁憂苦惱。	It was as if a loving father had only one child who suddenly fell ill and died, and after the remains were buried, that father returned home in disappointment, grief, and pain.
諸優婆塞憂愁苦惱亦復如是，以諸供具安置一處，却在一面，默然而坐。	The male lay followers were grieved and upset in much the same way. They then took what they had brought and put it all in one place, withdrew, sat off to one side in silence.
爾時復有三恒河沙諸優婆夷，受持五戒，威儀具足。	At that time there were also female lay followers (upasikas), present in numbers that totaled the sands of three Ganges Rivers. They upheld the five precepts and their conduct was impeccable.
其名曰：壽德優婆夷、德鬘優婆夷、毘舍佉優婆夷等八萬四千，而為上首。	The female lay followers Dignity of Life, Garland of Dignity, and Visakha were the leaders among their group of eighty-four thousand, all of whom capably maintained the true-dharma (saddharma) with tenacity.
悉能堪任護持正法，為度無量百千眾生故，現女身呵責家法。	In order to lead innumerable hundreds of thousands of living beings to the other shore they manifested themselves in female bodies, yet they disparaged the domestic dharma [pertaining to women ]. They meditated on their own bodies as four poisonous snakes, contemplating in this manner:
自觀己身如四毒蛇，是身常為無量諸虫之所唼食，是身臭穢、貪欲、獄縛，是身可惡猶如死狗，是身不淨九孔常流。	This body is being constantly nibbled at by innumerable small organisms. This body is foul smelling and unclean, shackled in a prison of greed. This b body is as loathsome as a dead dog.
是身如城，血肉筋骨皮裹其上，手足以為却敵樓櫓，目為竅孔，頭為殿堂，心王處中，	This body is impure with its nine holes from which matter continuously flows. This body is like a walled city in which blood, muscle, tendon, bone, and skin form its outer surface, in which hands and legs form its defense towers, in which the eyes are its windows, the head its palace with its mind king dwelling within.
如是身城，諸佛世尊之所棄捨，凡夫愚人常所味著，貪婬、瞋恚、愚癡、羅剎止住其中。	A bodycity like this is precisely what the buddhas, the world-honored ones, have abandoned and in what ordinary ignorant people always indulge themselves, where demons of craving, anger, and delusion reside.
是身不堅，猶如蘆葦、伊蘭、水泡、芭蕉之樹。	This body is not solid, much like marsh reeds, the castor oil plant, water bubbles, or the banana tree.
是身無常，念念不住，猶如電光、暴水、幻炎，亦如畫水，隨畫隨合。	This body is impermanent: from one thought to the next, nothing is ever settled. It is like lightning, flooding water, or an illusory heat shimmer. It is like painting something on water: no sooner has the form been inscribed by the brush than it is absorbed by the water.
是身易壞，猶如河岸臨峻大樹。	This body disintegrates easily, like a towering tree on the steep bank of a river.
是身不久當為狐狼、鵄梟、鵰鷲、烏鵲、餓狗，之所食噉。	This body will not last long; soon it will be devoured by foxes, wolves, kites, eagles, owls, crows, magpies, or hungry dogs.
誰有智者，當樂此身？	What intelligent person would take delight in the body?
寧以牛跡盛大海水，不能具說是身無常、不淨、臭穢。	It would be easier to put the waters of an ocean into the footprint of an ox than to fully explain how impermanent, impure, and odious this body is.
寧丸大地使如棗等，漸漸轉小猶葶藶子乃至微塵，不能具說是身過患。	It would be easier to roll up the earth into the size of a date, or to continue rolling it more and more until it is reduced to the size of a mustard seed, than to try and explain everything about the faults of this body.
是故當捨，如棄涕唾。	Therefore it is to be dispensed with, as one would expectorate saliva.
以是因緣，諸優婆夷，以空、無相、無願之法，常修其心。	With this reasoning these upasikas were continuously engaged in cultivating their thinking on the teachings of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness.
深樂諮受大乘經典，聞已亦能為他演說，護持本願，毀呰女身，甚可患厭，性不堅牢，心常修集如是正觀，破壞生死無際輪轉。	They deeply sought to delve into the Mahayana scriptures, and after hearing them they would expound them for others. They kept their vows and disdained their female bodies, regarding them as loathsome and their gender as insubstantial. Mentally they were always focused on proper contemplations like this, [seeking to] destroy their endless transmigration through samsara.
渴仰大乘，既自充足，復能充足餘渴仰者。	They were intoxicated with the Mahayana, and as they drew from it to satisfy their own thirst they also satisfied the thirst of others. For they held a deep longing for the Mahayana and were unwaveringly devoted to it.
深樂大乘，守護大乘，雖現女身，實是菩薩，善能隨順一切世間，度未度者，解未解者，紹三寶種使不斷絕，於未來世當轉法輪，以大莊嚴而自莊嚴，堅持禁戒，皆悉成就如是功德，於諸眾生生大悲心，平等無二，如視一子。	Although presently in female bodies, in fact they were bodhisattvas who skillfully adapted to the ways of the whole world in ferrying over those who had not yet reached the other shore. They bound together the Three Jewels to prevent their dissolution and in the future they will tum the wheel of the dharma and enhance it themselves with marvelous adornments, rigorously keeping the precepts. All of them will achieve merit in this way, bringing forth a mind of great compassion toward all living beings equally and without discrimination, looking upon each of them as one would look upon her only child.
亦於晨朝，日初出時各相謂言：「今日宜應至雙樹間。」	When the sun began to rise in the early morning, they spoke to each other, saying, Today we should go to the sal grove. Offerings were prepared by these female followers and brought to where the Buddha was.
諸優婆夷所設供具，倍勝於前，持至佛所，稽首佛足，遶百千匝，而白佛言：「世尊！	They bowed down at the Buddha's feet, circumambulated him one hundred thousand times, and then said to him:
我等今者，為佛及僧辦諸供具，唯願如來，哀受我供。」	World-Honored One, we have prepared these offerings for the Buddha and for the sangha. All we ask, Tathagata, is that you take pity upon us and accept our donations.
如來默然而不許可。	But the Tathagata remained silent and did not give his permission.
諸優婆夷不果所願，心懷惆悵，却坐一面。	Their wishes unfulfilled, all the female lay followers felt sad and disappointed. They withdrew and sat off to one side. On that occasion the Licchavi people from the city of Vaisali were also present.
爾時復有四恒河沙毘耶離城諸離車等，男女、大小、妻子眷屬，及閻浮提諸王眷屬，	 They numbered as many as the grains of sand in four Ganges Rivers. There were men, women, boys, girls, and mothers with children together with their families, as well as various rulers with their kinsmen from throughout the Jambudvipa continent.
為求法故，善修戒行，威儀具足，摧伏異學壞正法者，常相謂言：「我等當以金銀倉庫，為令甘露、無盡正法、深奧之藏久住於世。	 Because they sought the dharma, they properly cultivated the precepts and practices [taught by the Buddha] and were thus endowed with a dignified bearing that discouraged those from other schools of thought who denigrate the true-dharma. These people often said to each other: We should take our stores of gold and silver and use them to ensure that the profound treasury of the sweet, inexhaustible true-dharma remains in this world long into the future.
願令我等常得修學，若有誹謗佛正法者，當斷其舌。」	We hope we will always be able to practice and study [the dharma]. If anyone maligns the true-dharma of the Buddha, we shall cut off his tongue. They also made this vow:
復作是願：「若有出家毀禁戒者，我當罷令還俗策使。	If any monastic violates the precepts, we will detain that person, return him to lay status, and put him to work.
有能深樂、護持正法，我當敬重如事父母。	If there are those who deeply rejoice in and protect the true-dharma, we will respect them deeply just as we respect our fathers and mothers.
若有眾僧能修正法，我當隨喜令得勢力。」	If there are any monastics that are able to practice the true-dharma, we will celebrate them to give them strength.
常欲樂聞大乘經典，聞已亦能為人廣說，皆悉成就如是功德。	Since they were ever eager to listen with rapt attention to Mahayana scriptures and, after doing so, then worked to spread these teachings to others, each of them succeeded in accomplishing merit in this way.
其名曰：淨無垢藏離車子、淨不放逸離車子、恒水無垢淨德離車子，如是等各相謂言：「仁等，今可速往佛所。」	Among them were Licchavi children called Pure Unstained Treasure (Visuddhivimalagarbha), Pure and disciplined ( Visuddhyachanda), and Permanently Unstained Pure Ablution (Vimalagangodakadayaka). They said to each another: Let us hurry to where the Buddha is right now.
所辦供養，種種具足，一一離車，各嚴八萬四千大象，八萬四千駟馬寶車，八萬四千明月寶珠，天木、栴檀沈水、薪束，種種各有八萬四千。	 In the process they prepared a variety of offerings. Each of the Licchavis participated in decorating eighty-four thousand grand elephants and preparing wagons drawn by teams of four horses that totaled eighty-four thousand, adorned with eighty-four thousand bright jewels. They collected bundles of fragrant woods such as sandalwood and agarwood; each of these bundles included eighty-four thousand pieces.
一一象前，有寶幢幡蓋，其蓋小者，周匝縱廣滿一由旬，幡最短者長三十二由旬，寶幢卑者高百由旬。	In front of each elephant were hoisted ornamented banners, banderoles, and umbrellas. Even the smallest umbrella measured a full yojana in breadth, and the shortest banderole reached thirty-two yojanas in length, and even the plainest of the streamers was one hundred yojanas in height.
持如是等供養之具，往至佛所，稽首佛足，遶百千匝，而白佛言：	All these offerings were brought to where the Buddha resided. The Licchavis bowed down at the Buddha's feet and circumambulated him one hundred thousand times before speaking:
「世尊！我等今者，為佛及僧辦諸供具，唯願如來哀受我供。」	World-Honored One, we have prepared these offerings for the Buddha and the sangha. All we ask, Tathagata, is that you take pity on us and accept our donations.
如來默然而不許可。	But the Tathagata remained silent and did not give his permission.
諸離車等，不果所願，心懷愁惱。	Their wishes unfulfilled, the Licchavis felt disheartened.
以佛神力，去地七多羅樹，於虛空中默然而住。	Then, by means of the Buddha's supernatural powers, the Licchavis were raised above the earth to a height of seven palmyra trees, and there in the sky they remained in silence.
爾時復有五恒河沙大臣、長者，敬重大乘，若有異學謗正法者，是諸人等力能摧伏，猶如雹雨摧折草木。	At that time there were also important state officials and other distinguished lay followers who collectively numbered as many as the sands contained in five Ganges Rivers. They revered the Mahayana, and when people from other religious schools of thought repudiated the true-dharma, these leaders used their power to break these people down just as a hailstorm crushes plants and trees.
其名曰：日光長者、護世長者、護法長者，如是之等而為上首。	The principals in this lay group were known as the eminent Sunlight (Vairocana), the eminent Protector of the World (Lokapala), and the eminent Protector of the Dharma (Dharmapala).
所設供具，五倍於前，俱共往詣娑羅雙樹間，稽首佛足，遶百千匝，而白佛言：「世尊！	The offerings of this group totaled five times what had previously been given. They brought them into the area among the sal trees [where the Buddha sat] and, bowing down at the Buddha's feet, circumabulated him one hundred thousand times before addressing him, saying:
我等今者，為佛及僧設諸供具，唯願哀愍，受我等供。」	World-Honored One, we have prepared these offerings for the Buddha and the sangha. All we ask, Tathagata, is that you take pity on us and accept our donations.
如來默然而不受之。	a But the Tathagata remained silent and did not accept their gifts.
諸長者等，不果所願，心懷愁惱。	Their wishes unfulfilled, these distinguished individuals felt disheartened.
以佛神力，去地七多羅樹，於虛空中默然而住。	Then, by means of the Buddha's supernatural powers, they were raised above the earth to a height of seven palmyra trees, and there in the sky they remained in silence.
爾時復有應有六恒河沙毘舍離王，及其後宮夫人眷屬，閻浮提內所有諸王，除阿闍世并及城邑聚落人民。	At that time there was another group that included the king of Vaisali, his queen, consorts, and their retinue from court, together with all the other kings of Jambudvipa, excluding Ajatasatru and the people in his capital and the villages under his control.
其名曰月無垢王等，各嚴四兵，欲往佛所。 是一一王，各有一百八十萬億人民眷屬。	Among these kings was Unstained Moon (Vimalacandra). Each felt the need to journey to the Buddha's location, bolstered by four military divisions, resulting in each king arriving with one hundred and eighty trillion people in their entourage.
是諸車兵，駕以象馬，象有六牙，馬疾如風，莊嚴供具六倍於前。	The soldiers rode in chariots drawn by elephants and horses, the elephants had six tusks and the horses were as fast as the wind. Their offerings were beautiful and were six times the amount of what been brought previously.
寶蓋之中有極小者，周匝縱廣滿八由旬，幡極短者十六由旬，寶幢卑者三十六由旬。	The smallest of their jeweled umbrellas was fully eight yojanas across, the shortest of their banderoles was sixteen yojanas long, and the poorest specimen of their ornamented banners still reached thirty-six yojanas in length. These kings resided comfortably within the true-dhamma, reviling [other] dhammas that are base and corrupt.
是諸王等，皆悉安住於正法中，惡賤邪法，敬重大乘，深樂大乘，憐愍眾生，等如一子，所持飲食，香氣流布滿四由旬。	They revered the Mahayana; they cherished the Mahayana. They felt sympathy toward living beings, regarding them like their own children. The fragrance wafting from the food and drink they carried filled the air for four yojanas.
亦於晨朝日初出時，持是種種上妙甘饍，詣雙樹間，至如來所，而白佛言：「世尊！	As the sun began to rise in the early morning, they too brought their assortment of culinary creations to that place between the two trees, where they found the Tathagata and addressed him, saying:
我等為佛及比丘僧設是供具，唯願如來，哀愍受我最後供養。」	World-Honored One, we have provided these offerings for the Buddha and the sangha. All we ask, Tathagata, is that you take pity on us and accept our last offerings.
如來知時，亦不許可。	But the Tathagata, well aware of the situation, once again did not give his permission.
是諸王等，不果所願，心懷愁惱，却住一面。	Their wishes unfulfilled, the kings felt disheartened and withdrew to one side, where they remained.
爾時復有七恒河沙諸王夫人，唯除阿闍世王夫人，為度眾生，現受女身。	At that time all the imperial consorts, excluding only the consorts of King Ajatasatru, also came together and their numbers equaled the grains of sand in seven Ganges Rivers.
常觀身行，以空、無相、無願之法，薰修其心。	They had taken female forms for the purpose of ferrying living beings to the other shore, and were ever mindful of their behavior, having purified their minds by practicing the teachings on emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness.
其名曰：三界妙夫人、愛德夫人。	Among them were the [well-known] consorts Beautiful Woman of the Triple World and Beloved Virtue, but all these imperial women abided comfortably within the true-dharma. They practiced the precepts that endowed them with a bearing most dignified.
如是等諸王夫人，皆悉安住於正法中，修行禁戒，威儀具足，憐愍眾生，等如一子，各相謂言：「今宜速往，詣世尊所。」	Filled with compassion for living beings as if each was their only child, they said to each other, Let us now make haste and pilgrimage to where the Buddha resides. The offerings prepared by these royal consorts totaled seven times what had been brought previously.
諸王夫人，所設供養，七倍於前，香花、寶幢、繒綵、幡蓋、上妙飲食，寶蓋小者周匝縱廣十六由旬，幡最短者三十六由旬，寶幢卑者六十八由旬，飲食香氣，周遍流布滿八由旬。	They included fragrant flowers, ornamented banners, colored silk brocades, banderoles, umbrellas, and a superb assortment of food and drink. Among their jeweled umbrellas, the smallest reached sixteen yojanas across; the shortest of their banderoles measured thirty-six yojanas; and the most mediocre of their ornamented banners was sixty-eight yojanas in length. The fragrance from their food and drink filled the air for eight yojanas.
持如是等供養之具，往如來所，稽首佛足，遶百千匝，而白佛言：	Carrying these offerings, they went to the Tathagata and after making their obeisances at his feet, circumambulated him one hundred thousand times before addressing the Buddha, saying:
「世尊！我等為佛及比丘僧設是供具，唯願如來，哀愍受我最後供養。」	World-Honored One, we have provided these offerings for the Buddha and the sangha. All we ask, Tathagata, is that you take pity on us and accept these, our last offerings.
如來知時，默然不受。	But the Tathagata, well aware of the occasion, was silent and did not accept their gifts.
時諸夫人，不果所願，心懷愁惱，自拔頭髮，搥胸大哭，猶如新喪所愛之子，却在一面，默然而住。	Their wishes unfulfilled, the consorts then felt distraught, pulling out their hair, pounding their chests, and screaming like someone who had just lost a beloved child. Eventually they withdrew to one side and remained there in silence.
爾時復有八恒河沙諸天女等，其名曰廣目天女而為上首，作如是言：	At that time female deities also appeared, their numbers equaling the grains of sand in eight Ganges Rivers. Their leader was the goddess Wide Eyes (Virapaksa). She said the following:
「汝等諸姊！諦觀，諦觀，是諸人眾，所設種種上妙供具，欲供如來及比丘僧。	Sisters! Look carefully, look carefully. All these wonderful offerings have been provided by these people who hope to serve the Tathagata and the sangha.
我等亦當如是，嚴設微妙供具，供養如來，如來受已，當入涅槃。 諸姊！	We, too, should decorously provide marvelous things as offerings to the Tathagata. After the Tathagata accepts them, he will enter into nirvana.
諸佛如來，出世甚難，最後供養亦復倍難；	Sisters, it is extremely rare for these buddha tathagatas to appear in the world. This final offering should be twice as unusual as any other.
若佛涅槃，世間空虛。」	When the Buddha passes into nirvana, the world will be hollow.
是諸天女，愛樂大乘，欲聞大乘，聞已亦能為人廣說。	All these female deities cherished the Mahayana and thus looked forward to hearing more about it. Whenever they had an opportunity to listen to Mahayana teachings, they would then tum around and explain them to others. They were intoxicated with the Mahayana, and as they satisfied their own thirst they also satisfied the thirst of others.
渴仰大乘既自充足，復能充足餘渴仰者，守護大乘，若有異學，憎嫉大乘，勢能摧滅，如雹摧草。	They were unwaveringly devoted to the Mahayana-whenever they encountered followers of other teachings who felt jealousy and resentment toward the Mahayana, these deities vigorously crushed them, just as hail knocks down grass. They maintained the precepts and were thus endowed with dignified bearing.
護持戒行，威儀具足，善能隨順一切世間，度未度者，脫未脫者，於未來世當轉法輪、紹三寶種，使不斷絕，修學大乘，以大莊嚴而自莊嚴，成就如是無量功德，等慈眾生，如視一子。	In skillfully adapting to the ways of all worlds, they ferried over to the other shore those who had not yet reached it, and liberated those not yet liberated. In the future they will tum the wheel of the dharma, binding together the Three Jewels to prevent their dissolution. Studying the Mahayana, they will enhance it themselves with great adornments, in this way achieving immeasurable merit, and regarding all living beings with equal compassion, viewing each as if he or she was her only child.
亦於晨朝日初出時，各取種種天木香等，倍於人間所有香木，其木香氣，能滅人中種種臭穢。	As the sun began to rise in the early morning, the female deities brought an assortment of fragrant wood, incense, and the like in a quantity double [that brought by] the human pilgrims. The perfume from their wood was capable of eliminating a variety of the foul smells found among humans.
白車白蓋，駕四白馬，一一車上，皆張白帳，其帳四邊懸諸金鈴、種種香花、寶幢幡蓋，上妙甘饍，種種伎樂，敷師子座，其座四足純紺琉璃，於其座後，各各皆有七寶倚床，一一座前，復有金机，復以七寶而為燈樹，種種寶珠以為燈明，微妙天花遍布其地。	These deities rode on white chariots topped with white canopies and drawn by teams of four white horses. From the top of each chariot hung white curtains that stretched around the vehicle, and on all four sides hung gold bells. The chariots were also filled with various fragrant flowers, fancy banners, banderoles, umbrellas, superbly prepared foods, and theatrical performances. Each had set up a lion's seat [for the Tathagata], the four feet of which were made of the pure blue vaidurya gem. Behind each seat was a backrest decorated with seven jewels, and in front of each seat was a golden armrest. These seven jewels looked like a forest of lights in which the different precious stones all shone like lanterns.
是諸天女設是供已，心懷哀感，涕淚交流，生大苦惱。	Marvelous heavenly flowers covered the ground where the female deities laid out their offerings. When they were finished they felt overwhelmed with sadness; their tears flowed and flowed, producing great c discomfort among them.
亦為利益、安樂眾生，成就大乘第一空行，顯發如來方便密教，亦為不斷種種說法，往詣佛所，稽首佛足，遶百千匝，而白佛言：	In order to bring blessings and peace of mind to living beings, to accomplish the primary Mahayana practice of emptiness, to reveal the hidden teaching that is the Tathagata's skillful means, to prevent the extinction of his sermons, they approached the location of the Buddha, made obeisance at his feet, and circumambulated him one hundred thousand times before addressing him, saying:
「世尊！唯願如來，哀受我等最後供養。 」如來知時，默然不受。	 World-Honored One. All we ask, Tathagata, is that you take pity on us and accept these, our last offerings. But the Tathagata understood the situation and remained silent without accepting their gifts.
諸天女等，不果所願，心懷憂惱。	Their wishes unfulfilled, all the female deities felt agitated and distressed.
却在一面，默然而坐。	They withdrew to one side and there they sat in silence.
爾時復有九恒河沙諸龍王等，住於四方，其名曰：和修吉龍王、難陀龍王、婆難陀龍王而為上首。	At that time all the nagaraja dragon kings residing in the four directions came together, totaling a number equal to the grains of sand in nine Ganges Rivers. Their leaders were known as the dragon kings Yasuki, Nanda, and Upananda.
是諸龍王，亦於晨朝日初出時，設諸供具，倍於人天，持至佛所，稽首佛足，遶百千匝，而白佛言：「唯願如來，哀受我等最後供養。 」如來知時，默然不受。	As the sun began to rise in the early morning, these dragon kings prepared their own offerings, doubling the amount of those previously brought by humans and gods. Carrying them to the Buddha's presence, they made obeisance at his feet and circumambulated him one hundred thousand times before addressing him: All we ask, Tathagata, is that you take pity on us and accept these, our last offerings. The Tathagata, however, knowing the occasion, remained silent and did not accept their gifts.
是諸龍王，不果所願，心懷愁惱，却坐一面。	Their wishes unfulfilled, the dragon kings felt dejected, withdrew, and took their seats off to one side.
爾時復有十恒河沙諸鬼神王，毘沙門王而為上首，各相謂言：「仁等，今者可速詣佛所。」	At that time all the yak.ya demigod kings led by King Yaisravaf,la gathered in numbers equal to the grains of sand in ten Ganges Rivers.
設供具倍於諸龍，持往佛所，稽首佛足，遶百千匝，而白佛言：「唯願如來，哀受我等最後供養。」	They said to each other, Let us hurry to where the Buddha is! And preparing double the offerings brought by the dragon kings, they then carried these to the Buddha's presence. Making obeisance at his feet, they circumambulated him one hundred thousand times before addressing the Buddha: All we ask, Tathagata, is that you take pity on us and accept these, our last offerings. The Tathagata, however, understood the situation and remained silent without giving his permission.
如來知時，默然不許。 是諸鬼王，不果所願，心懷愁惱，却坐一面。	Their wishes unfulfilled, the demigod kings felt disheartened, withdrew, and took their seats off to one side.
爾時復有二十恒河沙金翅鳥王，降怨鳥王而為上首。	At that time there were also garuda bird kings totaling a number equal to the grains of sand in twenty Ganges Rivers; they were led by the bird king.

Having abandoned their evil mentality and no longer devouring people, these demons produced thoughts of compassion within their menacing nature.

復有十萬億恒河沙主雲雨神，皆作是念：「如來涅槃焚身之時，我當注雨，令火時滅，眾中熱悶為作清涼。」	There were also deities who ruled the clouds and the rain as numerous as the sands of ten trillion Ganges Rivers. They were all thinking: When, upon his nirvana the Tathagata's body is set alight for cremation, we shall pour rain from the sky and cause that fire to be extinguished. In this way those in the crowd that are burning with agony shall be refreshed.
復有二十恒河沙大香象王，羅睺象王、金色象王、甘味象王、紺眼象王，欲香象王等而為上首，敬重大乘，愛樂大乘，知佛不久當般涅槃，各各拔取無量無邊諸妙蓮花，來至佛所，頭面禮佛，却住一面。	 In addition, there were great fragrant elephant kings as numerous as the sands in twenty Ganges Rivers. They were led by the elephant kings Rahu, Suvarna, Madhu, Abhinilanetra, and Ghandamadana. They revered and longed for the Mahayana. Understanding that it would not be long before the Buddha passed into nirvana, they each gathered superb lotus flowers in innumerable, endless quantities and journeyed to where the Buddha sat.
復有二十恒河沙等師子獸王，師子吼王而為上首。	Bowing their heads in respect, they then withdrew to one side. There were also lions, king of beasts, whose numbers equaled the grains of sand in twenty Ganges Rivers, led by King Simhanada.

復有二十恒河沙等四天下中諸神仙人，忍辱仙等而為上首，持諸香花及諸甘果，來詣佛所，稽首佛足，遶佛三匝，而白佛言：「唯願世尊，哀受我等最後供養。」如來知時默然不許。	In addition, the seers who inhabited the four continents surrounding Mount Sumeru were also present, their numbers as numerous as the sands of twenty Ganges Rivers.

Making obeisance at the Buddha's feet, they circumambulated him three times before addressing him: All we ask, Tathagata, is that you take pity on us and accept these, our last offerings. The Tathagata, however, understood the situation and remained silent without giving his permission.
時諸仙人，不果所願。 心懷愁惱，却住一面。	Thereupon the seers, their wishes unfulfilled, felt disheartened, withdrew, and found a place off to one side.
閻浮提中一切蜂王，妙音蜂王而為上首，持種種花來詣佛所，稽首佛足，遶佛一匝，却住一面。	In Jambudvipa the bee kings were led by King Fine Sound. Bringing a variety of flowers, they made a pilgrimage to the Buddha's location. Making obeisance at the Buddha's feet, they withdrew to take their places off to one side.
爾時閻浮提中比丘、比丘尼一切皆集，唯除尊者摩訶迦葉、阿難二眾。	At that time all the monks and nuns of Jambudvipa were assembled, with the exception of the two groups of followers traveling with Venerable Mahakasyapa and Venerable Ananda.
復有無量阿僧祇恒河沙等世界中間，及閻浮提所有諸山，須彌山王而為上首，其山莊嚴，叢林蓊欝，諸樹茂盛，枝條扶踈，蔭蔽日光，種種妙花周遍而有，龍泉流水清淨香潔。	 Also present were mountains as numerous as the sands of immeasurable asamkhyeya Ganges Rivers contained in the world including Jambudvipa. With Mount Sumeru the most prominent among them, these mountains were adorned with forests in luxuriant growth. Their trees were so numerous and the branches so plentiful that they obscured the sunlight. A wide variety of exquisite flowers could be found in every direction, and the water flowing in their springs and rivers was pure, fragrant, and clear.
諸天、龍、神、乾闥婆、阿修羅、迦樓羅、緊那羅、摩睺羅伽，神仙呪術，作倡伎樂，如是等眾，彌滿其中。	The mountains were filled with deities (devas), dragons (nagas), demigods (yaksas), celestial musicians (gandharvas), titans (asuras), birds (garudas), celestial choristers (kimnaras), great serpents (mahoragas), saints (rsis), spell-casters (vidyadharas), and sky nymphs (apsarases).
是諸山神，亦來詣佛，稽首佛足，却住一面。	All these spiritual beings of the mountains likewise made a pilgrimage to see the Buddha. Making. obeisance at the Buddha's feet, they then withdrew to take their places off to one side.
復有阿僧祇恒河沙等四大海神及諸河神，有大威德，具大神足，所設供養，倍勝於前。	There were also deities from the four oceans, as well as deities residing in rivers who together were as numerous as the sands of innumerable Ganges Rivers. They possessed great supernatural power that comes from great spiritual power. The offerings they prepared were twice anything that had been brought up to that point.
諸神身光伎樂燈明，悉蔽日月令不復現。	The light emanating from their divine bodies shone [like] stage lighting, so brightly that it obstructed the sun and moon, making those heavenly bodies disappear.
以占婆花散熙連河，來至佛所，稽首佛足，却住一面。	They scattered asoka flowers over the Hiranyavati River and then came to the location of the Buddha, where they made obeisance at his feet and removed themselves to one side.
爾時拘尸那城娑羅樹林，其林變白，猶如白鶴。	At that time the grove of sal trees in Kusinagara turned white, appearing like a flock of white cranes.
於虛空中，自然而有七寶堂閣，彫文刻鏤，綺飾分明。	In the sky there suddenly appeared a hall made with seven jewels, carvings, engravings, and figured silk decorations, all of which could be clearly seen.
周匝欄楯，眾寶雜廁，堂下多有流泉浴池，上妙蓮花彌滿其中，猶如北方欝單越國，亦如忉利歡喜之園。	A parapet containing an assortment of jewels surrounded the hall, and below it water flowed from a number of springs into a bathing pool, the top of which was filled with magnificent lotus flowers. It looked like something from Uttarakuru, that land to the north, or like Indra's pleasure garden Nandanavana in the Trayastrirpsa Heaven.
爾時娑羅樹林中間，種種莊嚴，甚可愛樂，亦復如是。	Now at that time, the sal grove had been decorated in a number of ways and it struck those who looked upon it as quite lovely.
是諸天、人、阿修羅等，咸覩如來涅槃之相，皆悉悲感，愁憂不樂。	The gods and asuras [there] could all see the signs of the Tathagata's imminent nirvana and, without exception, each felt sad, forlorn, and unhappy.
爾時四天王釋提桓因，各相謂言：「汝等觀察，諸天、世人及阿修羅，大設供養，欲於最後供養如來。	At that time the guardian deities of the four directions and Sakra, lord of the gods (Sakra Devanam Indra), said to each other: See how both heavenly and worldly beings and even asuras have made such great preparations, hoping to present their final offerings to the Tathagata.
我等亦當如是供養，若我最後得供養者，檀波羅蜜則為成就滿足不難。」	We should also make an appropriate offering. If we can manage this final offering, the perfection of charity will become completely accomplished without difficulty.
爾時四天王所設供養，倍勝於前，持曼陀羅花、摩訶曼陀羅花、迦枳樓伽花、摩訶迦枳樓伽花、曼殊沙花、摩訶曼殊沙花、散多尼迦花、摩訶散多尼迦花、愛樂花、大愛樂花、普賢花、大普賢花、時花、大時花、香城花、大香城花、歡喜花、大歡喜花、發欲花、大發欲花、香醉花、大香醉花、普香花、大普香花、天金葉花、龍華、波利質多樹花、拘毘羅樹花，復持種種上妙甘饍，來至佛所，稽首佛足。	So the guardian deities of the four directions then prepared offerings that were twice what had been presented previously. They brought mandarava flowers, mahamandarava flowers, kakkolaka flowers, mahakakkolaka flowers, manjusaka flowers, mahamanjusaka flowers, samtanaka flowers, mahasamtanaka flowers, senna (manojna) flowers, grand senna flowers, universal brilliance (samantaprabha) flowers, grand universal brilliance flowers, clove (lavamga) flowers, grand clove flowers, fragrant city flowers, grand fragrant city flowers, flowers of joy (sumana), grand flowers of joy, desire-arousing lilies (saugandhika), grand desire-arousing lilies, intoxicated-with-fragrance (gandhamadana) flowers, grand intoxicated-with-fragrance flowers, universal fragrance (samantagandha) flowers, grand universal fragrance flowers, divine gold leaf (divyasuvarnapattra) flowers, dragon flowers, flowers from parijata trees, and flowers from kovidara trees. They also brought a variety of superbly prepared foods, and when they reached the Buddha they first made obeisance at his feet.
是諸天人所有光明，能覆日月，令不復現。	The illumination of all these heavenly beings was so bright that the sun and moon became invisible in the sky.
以是供具，欲供養佛。	Holding what they had brought, they then endeavored to be allowed to present their offerings to the Buddha.
如來知時，默然不受。	But the Tathagata, understanding the occasion, remained silent, thereby not accepting their gifts.
爾時諸天，不果所願，愁憂苦惱，却住一面。	Their wishes unfulfilled, these gods then felt disheartened and distressed, and withdrew to take their places off to one side.
爾時釋提桓因及三十三天，設諸供具亦倍勝前，及所持花亦復如是，香氣微妙甚可愛樂，持得勝堂并諸小堂，來至佛所，稽首佛足，而白佛言：	At that time Sakra and the other gods from the Trayastrilsa Heaven prepared offerings twice what had been brought previously and the flowers they brought were also of that scale. They had wondrous and extremely appealing perfumes and incense. Carrying Sakra's Vaijayanta palacel and a host of smaller halls, when they arrived where the Buddha was residing, they first bowed down at his feet to make their salutations and then addressed him, saying:
「世尊，我等深樂、愛護大乘，唯願如來哀受我食。」如來知時，默然不受。	 World-Honored One, we deeply appreciate the Mahayana and affectionately defend it. All we ask is that the Tathagata take pity on us and accept our food. But the Tathagata, understanding the occasion, remained silent and thereby did not accept their gifts.
時諸釋天，不果所願，心懷愁惱，却住一面。	Then Indra and the other gods, unable to realize their wish, felt disheartened. They withdrew to wait off to one side.
乃至第六天，所設供養展轉勝前，寶幢幡蓋。	All the way up to the sixth meditative heaven, the gods in the realm of desire (kamadhatu) prepared offerings, each in turn surpassing what had appeared before.
寶蓋小者覆四天下，幡最短者周圍四海，幢最卑者至自在天，微風吹幡，出妙音聲。	These decorated banners, banderoles, and umbrellas were so large that even the smallest jeweled umbrella covered the four continents of the earth, the shortest banderole stretched across four oceans, and the most inferior banner reached up to the heaven of Mahesvara. Whenever even a slight breeze blew against the banderoles, they produced a sound that was sublime.
持上甘饍，來詣佛所，稽首佛足，白佛言：「世尊，唯願如來哀受我等最後供養。」	Carrying the sweetest dishes of food, they journeyed to where the Buddha was and, ceremoniously bowing at his feet, addressed him in this way: World-Honored One, all we ask is that the Tathagata take pity on us and accept these, our final offerings. 
如來知時默然不受。	But the Tathagata, understanding the occasion, remained silent and did not accept.
是諸天等，不果所願，心懷愁惱，却住一面。	Realizing that their wishes would not be fulfilled, these gods felt disheartened and withdrew to wait off to one side.
上至有頂，其餘梵眾，一切來集。	Above the world of sense pleasure, all those residing in the Brahmli world at the peak of material existence in the realm of form only (rnpadhatu) I S also gathered together.
爾時大梵天王及餘梵眾，放身光明，遍四天下。	At that time a Mahlibrahmli king and his retinue ofBrahmli deities emitted a light that permeated the four continents.
欲界、人、天，日月光明，悉不復現。	It was so bright that it rendered the light given off by the sun and moon, and the people and gods of the realm of desire invisible.
持諸寶幢、繒綵、幡蓋，幡極短者懸於梵宮至娑羅樹間，來詣佛所，稽首佛足，白佛言：「世尊！	These gods also brought decorated banners, colored silk brocades, banderoles, and umbrellas. The absolutely shortest banderole extended from the Brahmli's palace all the way to this space within the sal forest. They made a pilgrimage to the Buddha's location, made their obeisance, and then addressed him, saying:
唯願如來，哀受我等最後供養。 」如來知時，默然不受。	World-Honored One, all we ask is a that the Tathagata take pity on us and accept these, our final offerings. But the Tathagata, understanding the occasion, remained silent and did not accept their gifts.
爾時諸梵不果所願，心懷愁惱，却住一面。	Their wishes unfulfilled, these Brahma gods then felt disheartened, and withdrew to take their places off to one side.
爾時毘摩質多阿修羅王，與無量阿修羅大眷屬俱，身諸光明，勝於梵天，持諸寶幢、繒綵、幡蓋，其蓋小者覆千世界，上妙甘饍，來詣佛所，稽首佛足，而白佛言：	At that time Vemacitra, king of the asuras, together with innumerable other asuras and a large retinue, [were also present]. The light that shone from their bodies surpassed even that of the gods in the Brahma Heaven. They also brought decorated banners, colored silk brocades, banderoles, and umbrellas. Even the smallest of their umbrellas could cover a thousand worlds. With the most sublime of sweet dishes, they made a pilgrimage to where Buddha was and, bowing at his feet, spoke these words:
「唯願如來，哀受我等最後供養。」如來知時，默然不受。	All we ask is that the Tathagata take pity on us and accept these, our final offerings. But the Tathagata, understanding the occasion, remained silent and did not accept.
諸阿修羅，不果所願，心懷愁惱，却住一面。	Their wishes unfulfilled, the asuras felt disheartened, withdrew, and remained off to one side.
爾時欲界魔王波旬與其眷屬、諸天婇女，無量無邊阿僧祇眾，開地獄門，施清冷水，因而告曰：	At that time king Mara Papiyas of the realm of desire, together with the innumerable, endless asamkhyeya hordes of beings belonging to his retinue, including gods and their female attendants, opened the gates of the hells and dispensed pure, cold water to those inhabitants. As a consequence of this, he then announced to them:
「汝等今者，無所能為，唯當專念如來、應、正遍知，建立最後隨喜供養，當令汝等長夜獲安。」	You feel you are unable to do anything [about your situation]. But if you will, just concentrate on the Tathagata, the One Worthy of Oblations, the Perfectly Enlightened One, and set forth your final offerings to express your joy in his virtuous accomplishments. This will bring you peace through the long night [that you must endure].
時魔波旬於地獄中，悉除刀劍無量苦毒，熾然炎火注雨滅之。	While in the hells, Mara Papiyas removed the instruments of torture and the many painful poisons; on the fiery flames he poured rainwater, extinguishing them.
以佛神力，復發是心，令諸眷屬，皆捨刀劍、弓弩、鎧仗、鉾槊、長鉤、金鎚、鉞斧、鬪輪、羂索，所持供養，倍勝一切人天所設，其蓋小者覆中千界，來至佛所，稽首佛足，而白佛言：「我等今者，愛樂大乘，守護大乘。	Then, by means of the Buddha's supernatural powers, he found himself thinking: I will make everyone in my retinue throw down their knives and swords, longbows and crossbows, armor and other hardware, halberds and lances, crescent bladed halberds, metallic bludgeons, broadaxes and hatchets, combat rings, and lasso ropes. The offerings brought by his group exceeded by twofold everything previously presented by humans and gods. Even the smallest of the umbrellas covered a thousand worlds. When they arrived at the Buddha's location, they bowed at his feet and said: We now long for the Mahayana, and are unwaveringly devoted to the Mahayana.
世尊！若有善男子善女人，為供養故、為怖畏故、為誑他故、為財利故、為隨他故受是大乘，或真或偽，我等爾時當為是人，除滅怖畏，說如是呪：「『啅抧　吒吒羅啅抧　盧呵隷　摩訶盧呵隷　阿羅　遮羅　多羅　莎呵』「是呪能令諸失心者、怖畏者、說法者、不斷正法者，為伏外道故、護己身故、護正法故、護大乘故，說如是呪。	World-Honored One, there may be good men or good women who accept the Mahayana because they seek to provide offerings, or because they are afraid, or because they intend to deceive others, or because of the prospect of financial gain, or because they are merely following others, and so they may regard it as true or as false. When this occurs, in order to eliminate the fears of such people, we teach them the following mantra: tarki ta!!ara tarki lohare mahalohare ara cara tara svaha Now for those who have lost their good intentions, for those tormented by fear, for those preaching the dharma (dharma-kathika), or for those preventing the dissolution of the true-dharma, this mantra is effective in overcoming rivals in heretical schools, in protecting oneself, in protecting the true-dharma, and in protecting the Mahayana.
若有能持如是呪者，無惡象怖，若至曠野、空澤、嶮處不生怖畏，亦無水火、師子虎狼、盜賊王難。	Anyone who uses the mantra properly will have no fear of mad elephants. Whenever they find themselves in a broad open field, or an endless swamp, or a place with precipitous slopes, with this spell they will feel no fear. And water, fire, lions, tigers, wolves, thieves, and troubles with kingsWorld-Honored One, if one can hold onto this mantra that person will be able to elminate completely any fear associated with these things.
世尊！若有能持如是呪者，悉能除滅如是等怖。 世尊！ 持是呪者，我當護之，如龜藏六。	World-Honored One, whosoever holds on to this mantra we will protect just as a tortoise guards his six extremities.
世尊！我等今者，不以諭諂說如是事，持是呪者，我當至誠，益其勢力。	World-Honored One, we do not speak of this to curry favor. We will faithfully increase the power of anyone who sustains this mantra.
唯願如來，哀受我等最後供養。」	All we ask, Tathagata, is that you take pity and accept these, our last offerings.
爾時佛告魔波旬言：「我不受汝飲食供養，我已受汝所說神呪，為欲安樂一切眾生、四部眾故。」	At that moment the Buddha said these words to Mara Papiyas: I cannot accept your offerings of food and drink. But I have accepted the mystical mantra that you have explained, for I want serene bliss for all living beings, including the four groups [of my followers] : monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.
佛說是已，默然不受。	After explaining this, the Buddha grew silent and accepted nothing further.
如是三請，皆亦不受。	Mara pleaded with the Buddha three times in the same way, but was refused each time.
時魔波旬，不果所願，心懷愁惱，却住一面。	His desires unfulfilled, Mara Papiyas felt disheartened and withdrew to take his place off to one side.
爾時大自在天王與其眷屬無量無邊，及諸天眾，所設供具，悉覆梵、釋、護世四王、人天八部、及非人等所有供具。	At that time Heavenly King Mahesvara and his retinue of limitless, innumerable gods prepared offerings the scope of which went beyond what had already been provided by Brahma, Indra, the Four Guardian Deities, humans, gods, the eight types of beings, and nonhumans.
梵釋所設，猶如聚墨在珂貝邊，悉不復現。	The offerings of Brahma and Indra now seemed like a series of black [lines] on the edge of a seashell that is not fully visible.
寶蓋小者能覆三千大千世界。	The smallest of their jeweled umbrellas were capable of covering the entire great trichiliocosm.
持如是等供養之具，來詣佛所，稽首佛足，遶無數匝，白佛言：	Bringing their offerings to where the Buddha resided, they made obeisance at his feet and then circumambulated him countless times before speaking:
「世尊！我等所獻微末供具，喻如蚊子供養於我，亦如有人以一掬水投於大海，然一小燈助百千日，春夏之月眾花茂盛，有持一花益於眾花，以亭歷子益須彌山，豈當有益大海、日明、眾花、須彌。	World-Honored One, what we respectfully present to you is trivial, something like what a mosquito might present to one of us, or like a man throwing a scoop of water into the ocean, or lighting one small lantern to add light to that of one hundred thousand suns, or bringing a single flower to increase the bounty of flowers blooming in the spring and summer months, or increasing the size of Mount Sumeru by adding a mustard seed to it. How could one increase the ocean, the sun's brightness, a field of flowers, or Mount Sumeru?
世尊！ 我今所奉微末供具，亦復如是。	World-Honored One, the insignificance of what we provide by way of offerings is much the same.
若以三千大千世界滿中香花、伎樂、幡蓋，供養如來，尚不足言。	Even if we were to offer to the Tathagata oblations of incense, flowers, theatrical performances, banners, and umbrellas enough to fill the great trichiliocosm, they would still not be worth mentioning.
何以故？ 如來為諸眾生，常於地獄、餓鬼、畜生諸惡趣中，受諸苦惱。	Because [we know] the Tathagata is perpetually concerned with taking up the suffering of living beings in the unfortunate hell, hungry ghost, and animal realms.
是故世尊！ 應見哀愍，受我等供。」	For this reason, World-Honored One, we hope that you may look upon us with pity and take up our offerings.
爾時東方去此無量無數阿僧祇恒河沙數微塵等世界，彼有佛土，名意樂美音，佛號虛空等如來、應供、正遍知、明行足、善逝、世間解、無上士、調御丈夫、天人師、佛、世尊。 爾時彼佛即告第一大弟子言：	At that time there was a buddha land in the eastern direction beyond infinitesimal worlds as numerous as the sands of immeasurable, endless asafTlkhyeya Ganges Rivers. This buddha land was called Mind-Pleasing Beautiful Sound (Manorama-madhurasvara), and the buddha there was known as Equal to Space (Akasasama), Tathagata, Worthy of Offerings, of Right and Universal Knowledge, with Clarity and Conduct Perfect, Well-Gone, with Understanding of the World, Unsurpassed Worthy, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha World-Honored One. At that time, the buddha Equal to Space said to his chief disciple:
「善男子！汝今宜往西方娑婆世界，彼土有佛，號釋迦牟尼如來、應供、正遍知、明行足、善逝、世間解、無上士、調御丈夫、天人師、佛、世尊，彼佛不久當般涅槃。	Good man, you should go now to that world in the west known as Saha. In that world there is a buddha known as S akyamuni, Tathagata, Worthy of Offerings, of Right and Universal Knowledge, with Clarity and Conduct Perfect, Well-Gone, with Understanding of the World, Unsurpassed c Worthy, Tamer of Men, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha WorldHonored One. It will not be long before this buddha will pass into extinction.
善男子！汝可持此世界香飯——其飯香美，食之安隱——可以此食，奉獻彼佛世尊，世尊食已，入般涅槃。	Good man, you should take him fragrant dishes of food from this world. The food should be aromatic and attractive in appearance, and when eaten should bring peace and comfort. Present this food to that world-honored buddha. When that world-honored one has eaten it, he will enter parinirvana.
善男子！并可禮敬，請決所疑。」	Good man, you must also show him your deepest reverence and entreat him to resolve your doubts.
爾時無邊身菩薩摩訶薩即受佛教，從座而起，稽首佛足，右遶三匝，與無量阿僧祇菩薩俱，從彼國發，來至此娑婆世界。	Then, having thus received that buddha's teaching, the bodhisattva-mahasattva Anantakaya rose from his seat, bowed down to the feet of his buddha, and circumambulated him three times with his right shoulder facing the buddha. Then, together with innumerable asamkhyeya of bodhisattvas, he embarked from that land and came to this Saha world.
應時此間三千大千世界大地，六種震動。	In response to the occasion, the continents of the great trichiliocosm shook in six different ways.
於是眾中，梵、釋、四天王、魔王波旬、摩醯首羅，如是大眾，見是地動，舉身毛竪，喉舌枯燥，驚怖戰慄，各欲四散。	Everyone assembled there, such as Brahma, Indra, the Four Guardian Deities, Mara Papiyas, and Mahesvara, saw the earth move, felt the hair on their bodies stand up, and their throats become dry. They trembled with fright, each wanting to flee in a different direction.
自見其身，無復光明，所有威德，殄滅無餘。	Looking at themselves, they noticed that they no longer radiated light; in fact their spiritual powers had vanished without a trace.
是時文殊師利法王子，即從座起，告諸大眾：	At that moment Manjusri, the Dharma Prince, rose from his seat and spoke to the huge crowd:
「諸善男子！汝等勿怖，汝等勿怖。 何以故？	Good men, have no fear, have no fear!
東方去此無量無數阿僧祇恒河沙微塵等世界，有世界名意樂美音，佛號虛空等如來、應、正遍知，十號具足，彼有菩薩名無邊身，與無量菩薩，欲來至此供養如來。	Because to the east of here beyond infinitesimal worlds as numerous as the sands of immeasurable uncountable asafJlkhyeya Ganges Rivers there is a world called Mindpleasing Beautiful Sound. The buddha there is called Equal to Space, Tathagata, Worthy of Offerings, of Right and Universal Knowledge, and indeed all the ten epithets of a buddha. There is also a bodhisattva there called Anantakaya who, together with innumerable other bodhisattvas, wishes to come here to make offerings to the Tathagata.
以彼菩薩威德力故，令汝身光悉不復現。	It is because of the spiritual power of this bodhisattva that your body's illumination is no longer visible.
是故汝等應生歡喜，勿懷恐怖。」	You should therefore be joyful at what has happened, rather than fearful.
爾時大眾，悉皆遙見彼佛大眾，如明鏡中自觀己身。	Then the great assembly looked off into the distance and saw the approach of that other buddha's great assembly. It was as if they were looking at their own images reflected in a giant mirror.
時文殊師利復告大眾：「汝今所見彼佛大眾，如見此佛。	At that point, Manjusri addressed the crowd once more : What you now see is the great assembly of that buddha, just as you see this buddha.
以佛神力，復當如是得見九方無量諸佛。」	By means of the supernatural powers of the buddhas you will now be able to see all the countless buddhas in the other nine directions.
爾時大眾各相謂言：「苦哉，苦哉！	But the great assembly then remarked to each other, Dreadful, positively dreadful.
世間空虛空虛，如來不久當般涅槃。」	The world is hollow! The Tathagata will soon pass into parinirvana. 
是時大眾一切悉見無邊身菩薩及其眷屬，林樹花果茂盛，微風吹動出微妙音，其聲和雅，猶如天樂。	Then everyone in the crowd saw the bodhisattva Anantakaya and his retinue approach. 
是菩薩身，一一毛孔，各各出生一大蓮花，一一蓮花各有七萬八千城邑，	From each and every pore on that bodhisattva's body there arose a large lotus flower, and in each and every lotus flower there were seventy-eight thousand towns. 
縱廣正等如毘耶離城，	In length and width each town was equal to that of Vaisaa.
牆壁諸塹七寶雜廁，多羅寶樹七重行列，	They had walls and moats with the seven precious things scattered throughout, and seven rows of bejeweled palmyra trees.
人民熾盛安隱豐樂，	The people there were prosperous, lived in peace and security, enjoyed abundant provisions, and were happy.
閻浮檀金以為却敵，一一却敵，各有種種七寶，	Gold from the lamba River was used for the coping of the gate towers, and upon each grew a variety of groves of trees of the seven precious things.
林樹花果茂盛，微風吹動出微妙音，其聲和雅，猶如天樂。	These produced flowers and fruit in abundance, which produced a subtle and marvelous sound whenever they were stirred by the wind.
城中人民，聞是音聲，即得受於上妙快樂。 是諸塹中，妙水盈滿，清淨香潔如真琉璃。	This sound was so elegant as to seem like heavenly music, and it gave a sublime sense of pleasure to the people in the city when they heard it.The moats brimmed with superb water that was clear, pure, fragrant, and clean like pure vaidurya.
是諸水中有七寶船，諸人乘之遊戲澡浴，共相娛樂，快樂無極。	In those waters were boats with the seven precious things in which people rode, at times playing and bathing in the water, enj oying themselves in endless amusement.
復有無量雜色蓮花，優鉢羅花、拘物頭花、波頭摩花、分陀利花，其花縱廣猶如車輪。	There were also lotus flowers of an innumerable variety of colors, such as the blue, yellow, red, and white, and the diameter of each was the size of a cartwheel.
其塹岸上，多有園林，一一園中有五泉池，是諸池中復有諸花，優鉢羅花、拘物頭花、波頭摩花、分陀利花，	On the banks of the moats were many parks with trees, and within each park were five natural ponds. There were also flowers growing within these ponds, namely blue, yellow, red, and white lotuses.
其花縱廣亦如車輪，香氣馚馥，甚可愛樂。	They, too, were as big as cartwheels, their odor richly fragrant, and these flowers were loved by everyone.
其水清淨柔軟第一，鳧鴈鴛鴦遊戲其中。	The water in the ponds was clear and as soft as could be, and wild ducks, wild geese, and mandarin ducks frolicked in it. Each of these parks also had a jeweled villa.
其園各有眾寶宮宅，一一宮宅縱廣正等滿四由旬，所有牆壁四寶所成，所謂金銀琉璃頗梨，真金為嚮，周匝欄楯，	The length and width of each of these villas were fully four yojanas in size, with walls constructed of the four precious stones: gold, silver, vaidurya, and crystal. Pure gold formed the edge on the perimeter fences.
玫瑰為地，金沙布上。是宮宅中，多有七寶流泉浴池，	The ground was made of quartz with gold dust covering it. Within the villas were numerous seven-jeweled bathing ponds filled with water flowing from springs. 
一一池邊，各有十八黃金梯陛，閻浮檀金為芭蕉樹，如忉利天歡喜之園。	On the edge of each bathing pond was a golden stairway of eighteen steps [lined with] banana trees made of gold from the Jamba River, and the whole scene resembled the pleasure gardens in the Trayastrimsa Heaven.
是一一城，各有八萬四千人王，一一諸王，各有無量夫人、婇女，共相娛樂，歡喜受樂。	In each town were human kings numbering eighty-four thousand. Each king had innumerable numbers of consorts and female attendants, with whom the king enjoyed and amused himself happily.
其餘人民，亦復如是，各於住處，共相娛樂。	The other people were similarly [happy], each enjoying himself in his respective abode.
是中眾生，不聞餘名，純聞無上大乘之聲。	Here living beings did not hear of anything else of reknown-they listened solely to the sound of the unsurpassed Mahayana.
是諸花中，一一各有師子之座，其座四足皆紺琉璃，柔軟素衣以布座上，其衣微妙出過三界。	Within each flower there was also a lion's seat, the four legs of which were all constructed of dark blue vaidurya.
一一座上，有一王坐，以大乘法教化眾生，	Laid on each of these seats was a soft, white fabric more exquisite than anything in the triple world. On each of these seats sat a king who educated living beings by means of the Mahayana teachings.
或有眾生書持、讀誦，如說修行，如是流布大乘經典。	The living beings in attendance engaged in copying, reading and reciting, and practicing what was expounded to them. By doing so they helped spread the Mahayana scriptures.
爾時無邊身菩薩，安止如是無量眾生，於自身已令捨世樂，皆作是言：	At that time the bodhisattva Anantakaya pacified the uncountable number of living beings [in the lotus flowers], by moving them to abandon their pursuit of worldly pleasures by themselves. And yet they [too] all exclaimed,
「苦哉，苦哉！世間空虛，如來不久當般涅槃。」	 Dreadful, positively dreadful. The world is hollow! The Tathagata will soon pass into parinirvana.
爾時無邊身菩薩，與無量菩薩周匝圍遶，示現如是神通力已，持是種種無量供具，及以上妙香美飲食，若有得聞是食香氣，煩惱諸垢皆悉消滅。	Then the bodhisattva Anantakaya together with the innumerable other bodhisattvas that surrounded him, manifested his supernatural powers by bringing a variety of offerings, immeasurable b in scope, including superbly fragrant and attractive food and drink, and announced that anyone who could smell the aroma of these foods would have the stains of all their defilements eliminated.
以是菩薩神通力故，一切大眾悉皆得見如是變化。	And by means of his supernatural powers as a bodhisattva, all the living beings [present] were indeed able to see these miraculous transformations.
無邊身菩薩身大無邊、量同虛空，唯除諸佛，餘無能見是菩薩身其量邊際。	But the body of the bodhisattva Anantakaya was limitless in size, fully as large as space itself, so, with the exception of the buddhas, no one else was able to see the end point of this bodhisattva's body.
爾時無邊身菩薩及其眷屬，所設供養倍勝於前，來至佛所，稽首佛足，合掌恭敬白佛言：	It was then that the bodhisattva Anantakaya and his retinue took their prepared offerings-twice what had been brought previously-and brought them to where the Buddha was. Making obeisance at his feet, they placed their palms together in reverence and addressed the Buddha, saying,
「世尊！ 唯願哀愍，受我等食。 」如來知時，默然不受。 如是三請，悉亦不受。	World-Honored One, all we ask is that you take pity on us and accept our food. But the Tathagata understood the occasion and remained silent, not accepting the offering. Thus he was asked three times, but never accepted.
爾時無邊身菩薩及其眷屬，却住一面。	Then the bodhisattva Anantakaya and his retinue withdrew and remained off to one side.
南西北方諸佛世界，亦有無量無邊身菩薩，所持供養倍勝於前，來至佛所，乃至却住一面，皆亦如是。	In the southern, western, and northern directions there were other buddha realms from which innumerable other bodhisattvas of incalculable, boundless size also came, bearing offerings that were twice what had been brought previously. Entering into the august presence of the Buddha, they also ended up withdrawing off to one side, like everyone else.
爾時娑羅雙樹吉祥福地，縱廣三十二由旬，大眾充滿，間無空缺。	At that time, the auspicious and felicitous ground of the sal forest was completely filled by the enormous crowd that had now gathered, and even though the forest measured thirty-two yojanas in both length and width, there was not an empty space to be found.
爾時四方無邊身菩薩及其眷屬所坐之處，或如錐頭、針鋒、微塵，	The only space where all the boundless body (anantakaya) bodhisattvas of the four directions and their retinues could sit were often no bigger than the head of an awl, the point of a needle, or a speck of dust.
十方如微塵等諸佛世界諸大菩薩，悉來集會，及閻浮提一切大眾，亦悉來集——唯除尊者摩訶迦葉、阿難二眾，阿闍世王及其眷屬	Nonetheless, all the great bodhisattvas of the many buddha realms in all the ten directions, even as small as specks of dust, came and were now assembled, and all living beings in Jambudvipa had come as well. The only exceptions were the two groups associated with Venerable Mahakasyapa and Venerable Ananda, as well as King Ajatasatru and his retinue. 
——乃至毒蛇，視能殺人蜣蜋、蝮蝎，及十六種行惡業者，一切來集。	Poisonous snakes that can kill a man on sight, dung beetle vipers, scorpions, and people who have committed the sixteen evil acts--even all these were assembled there.
陀那婆神、阿修羅等，悉捨惡念，皆生慈心，如父、如母、如姊、如妹； 三千大千世界眾生，慈心相向，亦復如是，除一闡提。	The danavas and asuras completely put aside their harmful thoughts, and instead they all produced minds of compassion. Like fathers, like mothers, like elder sisters, and like younger sisters, all living beings in the great trichiliocosm looked upon each other with the same attitude of compassion, with the exception of the icchantikas.
爾時三千大千世界，以佛神力故，地皆柔軟，無有丘墟、土沙、礫石、荊棘、毒草，眾寶莊嚴，猶如西方無量壽佛極樂世界。	 At that time the ground in all worlds of this great trichiliocosm became soft due to the spiritual authority of the Buddha. There were no more hills, wastelands, sand, gravel, rocks, thorns, or poisonous plants. The land became so adorned with precious stones that it resembeled the Sukhavati Western Paradise of Amitayus Buddha.
是時大眾悉見十方如微塵等諸佛世界，如於明鏡自觀己身，見諸佛土亦復如是。	At this point everyone in the great assembly was able to see the buddha lands (buddhaksetras) of the ten directions like so many specks of dust. As clear as if they were seeing their own image in a mirror, that is how well they were able to see the buddha lands.
爾時如來面門所出五色光明，其光明曜覆諸大會，令彼身光，悉不復現；	Then a five-colored ray of light began to shine from the Tathagata's mouth. The light was so bright that it permeated the entire congregation, rendering the bodily radiance given off by others no longer visible.
所應作已，還從口入。	After serving its purpose, the light returned to the Buddha's mouth from which it had come and disappeared.
時諸天人及諸會眾，阿修羅等，見佛光明，還從口入，皆大恐怖，身毛為竪，復作是言：「如來光明出已還入，非無因緣，必於十方所作已辦，	When the assembled gods, humans, and asuras saw the Buddha's light return and enter his mouth, they were all seized with fear, the hair on their bodies standing on end. They said: This shining forth and returning of the light from the Tathagata must not be without reason. It is certain that he has now taken care of what he needs to do in the ten directions.
將是最後涅槃之相。 何期苦哉，何期苦哉！如何？	The sign of the final nirvana, what will it be? What will it be?
世尊一旦捨離四無量心，不受人天所奉供養，聖慧日光從今永滅，無上法船於斯沈沒。	Why would the World-Honored One suddenly abandon the four immeasurable minds and refuse to accept the oblations offered by both humans and deities? From now on, the sunlight of sacred wisdom will be extinguished forever. The ship of the all-encompassing dharma will hereby sink!
嗚呼痛哉，世間大苦。」	Ah, how depressing! The world is to be engulfed in suffering!
舉手搥胸，悲號啼哭，支節戰動，不能自持，身諸毛孔流血灑地。	With their hands they pounded their chests and cried out in a sad lament. Their limbs trembled and they were not able to support themselves. Blood flowed from their pores, spilling on to the earth.
爾時會中有優婆塞，是拘尸那城工巧之子，名曰純陀，與其同類十五人俱。為令世間得善果故，捨身威儀，從座而起，	At that time there was a lay follower in the assembly named Cunda who was the son of an artisan in Kusinagara. In order to better enable [the living beings of] the world to earn beneficial karmic merit, Cunda, together with fifteen others of like mind, put aside their usual comportment and rose from their seated positions.
偏袒右肩，右膝著地，合掌向佛，悲泣墮淚，頂禮佛足，而白佛言：「唯願世尊及比丘僧，哀受我等最後供養，為度無量諸眾生故。	They bared their right shoulders, put their right knees on the ground, joined their palms and, facing the Buddha, began to weep, their tears pouring out. Paying respect at the Buddha's feet, they then addressed him, saying: All we ask of the World-Honored One and the bhiksus is that you take pity on us and accept our last offerings of alms so that you may ferry innumerable living beings over [to the other shore].
世尊！我等從今無主、無親、無救、無護、無歸、無趣、貧窮飢困，欲從如來求將來食，唯願哀愍，受我微供，然後乃入於般涅槃。 世尊！	World-Honored One, from now on we will have no master, no parents, no savior, no protector, no refuge, and no destination. Impoverished and hungry, we wish to follow the Tathagata [and assume that] our nourishment will come in the future. All we ask is that you sympathize with us and accept our meager offerings, and only after that enter parinirvana.
譬如剎利、若婆羅門、毘舍、首陀，以貧窮故，遠至他國，役力農作，得好調牛，良田平正，無諸沙鹵、惡草、株杌，唯悕天雨。	World-Honored One, it is like those from military (ksatriya), priestly (brahmana), merchant (vaisya), or peasant (sudra) backgrounds that, compelled by poverty, journey to far-off lands. They pour their labors into farming, obtaining a well-tamed ox and taking a fertile field and making it flat without any sand, harmful weeds, or tree stumps. All they seek is rain from the heavens.
言調牛者，喻身口七。 良田平正，喻於智慧。	The tamed ox that we speak of is a metaphor for the seven ways [we control] our actions and speech [for the karma it creates]. The fertile field is a metaphor for spiritual wisdom (prajna).
除去沙鹵、惡草、株杌，喻除煩惱。	Removing the sand, harmful weeds, and tree stumps is a metaphor for removing the defilements (klesas).
世尊！ 我今身有調牛、良田、除去株杌，唯悕如來甘露法雨。	World-Honored One, there are now trained oxen in us that have removed the tree stumps from fertile fields; we look only to you, Tathagata, for the dharma rain that is the ambrosia of immortality (amrta) to us.
貧四姓者，即我身是，貧於無上法之財寶。	The impoverished four castes are none other than the impoverishment of who we are with respect to the wealth of the unsurpassed dharma.
唯願哀愍，除斷我等貧窮困苦，拯及無量苦惱眾生。	All we ask is that you take pity and eradicate our poverty and pain, thereby lifting up the immeasurable number of suffering living beings.
我今所供，雖復微少，冀得充足如來大眾。	What we have to offer may be small and trivial, but we nevertheless hope that it may satisfy the Tathagata and the community.
我今無主、無親、無歸，願垂矜愍，如羅睺羅。」	We now face having no master, no parents, and no refuge [after you are gone]; we come to you wishing for the compassion you would extend to [your son] Rahula.
爾時世尊、一切種智、無上調御，告純陀曰：	At that time the World-Honored One, the Omniscient, the Unsurpassed Tamer, addressed Cunda, saying:
「善哉，善哉！我今為汝除斷貧窮，無上法雨雨汝身田，令生法芽。	Excellent! Excellent! I will now indeed remove this poverty for you. The rain of the unsurpassed dharma will fall upon your karmic field, bringing forth a dharma sprout.
汝今於我，欲求壽命、色力、安、辯，我當施汝常命、色力、安、無礙辯。 何以故？	What you seek in me is life, form, power, serenity, and lucidity. I will indeed provide you with continual life, form, power, serenity, and unimpeded lucidity.
純陀！ 施食有二，果報無差。	Cunda, donating nourishment [as you have done] will have two karmic rewards that are indistinguishable.
何等為二？	What are these two?
一者受已，得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提；	First is that after the donation i s accepted, [the donor] attains anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.
二者受已，入於涅槃。	Second is that after the donation is accepted, [the donor] enters nirvana.
我今受汝最後供養，令汝具足檀波羅蜜。」	I now accept this last offering from you, and [thereby] bring you to the completion of the perfection of charity (dana-paramita).
爾時純陀即白佛言：「如佛所說，二施果報無差別者，是義不然。	At that time, Cunda immediately spoke to the Buddha, saying: The Buddha has said that the two karmic rewards of donations like mine are indistinguishable, but this does not make sense to me.
何以故？ 先受施者，煩惱未盡，未得成就一切種智，亦未能令眾生具足檀波羅蜜；	Because in the first instance of one who has had his donation accepted, the defilements will not have been exhausted, omniscient wisdom will not have been achieved, and there will be no ability to enable [other] living beings to complete the perfection of charity [through similar acts of giving].
後受施者，煩惱已盡，已得成就一切種智，能令眾生普得具足檀波羅蜜。	Whereas in the second instance of one who has had his donation accepted, the defilements will have been exhausted, omniscient wisdom will have been achieved, and he will have acquired the ability to guide other living beings to complete the perfection of charity.
先受施者，直是眾生；	In the first instance, the one who has had his donation accepted is merely a living being.
後受施者，是天中天。	In the second instance, the one who has had his donation accepted is a god among gods.
先受施者，是雜食身、煩惱之身、是後邊身、是無常身；	In the first instance, the one who has had his donation accepted has a body sustained by various forms of eating, a body still deluded with the defilements, a body that has a final limit, a body that is impermanent.
後受施者，無煩惱身、金剛之身、法身、常身、無邊之身。	In the second instance, the one who has had his donation accepted has a body devoid of the defilements, a vajra (adamantine) body, a dharma body, a permanent body, a body without limits.
云何而言，二施果報等無差別？	Why, then, do you say that they are equal and without distinction?
先受施者，未能具足檀波羅蜜乃至般若波羅蜜，唯得肉眼，未得佛眼乃至慧眼； 後受施者，已得具足檀波羅蜜乃至般若波羅蜜，具足佛眼乃至慧眼。	In the first instance, the one who has had his donation accepted is not yet able to complete the perfection of charity nor any of the other perfections up through and including the perfection of wisdom. He only has physical eyes, he has not yet attained the eyes of a buddha nor any of the other forms of seeing, up through and including the eyes of spiritual wisdom. In the second instance, the one who has had his donation accepted has already completed the perfection of charity and all the other perfections up through the perfection of wisdom. He is endowed with the eyes of a buddha and the other forms of seeing, up through the eyes of wisdom.
云何而言二施果報等無差別？	Why, then, do you say the two karmic effects of donations are indistinguishable?
世尊！先受施者，受已食噉，入腹消化，得命、得色、得力、得安、得無礙辯；	World-Honored One, the first one who has had his donation accepted chews the food he receives, swallows it, and digests it. He thereby gains life, form, power, serenity, and unimpeded lucidity.
後受施者，不食、不消、無五事果；	The second one who has had his donation accepted does not eat food, does not digest food, and gains none of the five nutritional effects [of eating].
云何而言二施果報等無差別？」	Why, then, do you say the two karmic effects of donations are indistinguishable?
佛言：	The Buddha said:
「善男子！如來已於無量無邊阿僧祇劫，無有食身、煩惱之身，無後邊身，常身、法身、金剛之身。	Good man, for innumerable, asamkhyeya kalpas the Tathagata has had a body that is not nourished by food nor affected by the defilements, a body without limits, a permanent body, a dharma body, a vajra body.
善男子，未見佛性者，名煩惱身、雜食之身，是後邊身。	 b Good man, it is those who have not seen the buddha-nature that I name as having a body affected by the defilements, a body that is sustained by food, a body that has limits.
菩薩爾時受飲食已，入金剛三昧，此食消已，即見佛性，得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，是故我言，二施果報等無差別。	A bodhisattva on this occasion who, after accepting a donation of food and drink, enters the vajra-samadhi is someone who will, after his meal is digested, immediately see the buddha-nature and attain anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. For this reason I say the two karmic effects of the donations are equivalent and indistinguishable.
菩薩爾時破壞四魔，今入涅槃，亦破四魔，是故我言二施果報等無差別。	A bodhisattva on this occasion destroys the four maras, and if he were to enter nirvana he would also destroy the four maras. For this reason I say the two karmic effects of the donations are equivalent and indistinguishable.
菩薩爾時雖不廣說十二部經，先已通達，今入涅槃，廣為眾生分別演說，是故我言二施果報等無差別。	A bodhisattva on this occasion, though he may not [be able to] explain everything among the scriptures that make up the twelvefold canon, is certainly more proficient in them than he had been previously. And if he were to enter nirvana he would analyze and elucidate the [canon] for the sake of living beings in detail. For this reason I say the two karmic effects of the donations are equivalent and indistinguishable.
善男子！ 如來之身，已於無量阿僧祇劫不受飲食。	Good man, for innumerable, asamkhyeya kalpas the body of the Tathagata has not accepted any food or drink.
為諸聲聞說言，先受難陀、難陀波羅二牧牛女所奉乳糜，然後乃得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提；	For the sravakas I did say, First I accepted the milk porridge offered by the two oxherding women, Nanda and Nandabala. Only afterward did I then attain anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.
我實不食。	But in fact I did not eat anything.
我今為於此會大眾，是故受汝最後所奉；	That I now accept your last offerings is for the sake of this great assembly.
實亦不食。」	But in fact I will not eat any of it.
爾時大眾聞佛世尊，普為大會受於純陀最後供養，歡喜踊躍同聲讚言：	At that time, hearing that the Buddha and World-Honored One would accept the last offering of alms from Cunda for the sake of the entire assembly, the crowd became ecstatic and shouted out their praise in unison:
「善哉，善哉！希有純陀！	Excellent, excellent! How rare this is, Cunda!
汝今立字，名不虛稱。 言純陀者，名解妙義。	The name by which you are recognized is not meaningless, for Cunda means to understand subtle meanings. And now you have established something of great meaning.
汝今建立如是大義，是故依實從義立名，故名純陀。	Thus your name has been established on the basis of the truth that accords with meaning. That is why you are known as Cunda.
汝今現世得大名利，德願滿足。	In all the world it is you who have now gained great fame and profit; your auspicious wish has been fulfilled.
甚奇純陀！ 生在人中，復得難得無上之利。	How remarkable, Cunda, that among all people living today it is you who have obtained what is so difficult to obtain and what is so unsurpassed in value.
善哉純陀！	Excellent, Cunda.
如優曇花世間希有，佛出於世亦復甚難，值佛生信聞法復難，佛臨涅槃最後供養，能辦是事復難於是。	This is as rare as the appearance of the udumbara flower in the world. It is extremely uncommon for a buddha to appear in the world, and uncommon as well to meet a buddha, to put forth faith, and to truly hear the dharma. But to be able to make the final offering when the Buddha is facing his nirvfu;la-to be able to do that! How much more uncommon!
南無純陀，南無純陀！汝今已具檀波羅蜜，	Homage to Cunda! Homage to Cunda! You have accomplished the perfection of charity!
猶如秋月，十五日夜，清淨圓滿，無諸雲翳，一切眾生無不瞻仰；	It is like an autumn moon on the evening of the fifteenth of the month: clear, perfectly round, and not covered by any clouds. All living beings cannot help but look upon it with reverence.
汝亦如是，而為我等之所瞻仰。	You, too, are like this, and thus we look upon you with reverence.
佛已受汝最後供養，令汝具足檀波羅蜜。 南無純陀！	The Buddha has already accepted your final offering, enabling you to complete the perfection of charity. Homage to Cunda!
是故說汝如月盛滿，一切眾生無不瞻仰。 南無純陀！	This is why we say you are like the full moon, and all living beings cannot help but regard you with reverence. Homage to Cunda!
雖受人身，心如佛心。	Although you have a human body, your mind is like a buddha-mind.
汝今純陀，真是佛子，如羅睺羅，等無有異。」	Now you are Cunda, but in reality you are the son of the Buddha, no different from his son Rahula.
爾時大眾即說偈言： 「汝雖生人道， 已超第六天， 我及一切眾， 今故稽首請。	Then, from the great assembly, the following verses were proclaimed: Although you were born in the human realm, You have gone beyond the sixth heaven.o Myself and everyone else in the assembly, Thus bow down and beseech you now.
人中最勝尊， 今當入涅槃， 汝應愍我等， 唯願速請佛， 久住於世間， 利益無量眾， 演說智所讚， 無上甘露法。	The holiest among the people, Is about to enter nirvana now. You should take pity on us. For all we ask is that you quickly implore the Buddha, To long remain in this world, Benefiting countless beings, Expounding the wise, praiseworthy Dharma that is sublime ambrosia.
汝若不請佛， 我命將不全， 是故應見為， 稽請調御師。」	If you do not implore the Buddha thus, Our lives will never be whole. For this reason you must see him. Bow down and plead with our lord and protector (natha)!
爾時純陀歡喜踊躍，譬如有人，父母卒喪忽然還活，純陀歡喜亦復如是，	 At that moment Cunda was overcome with joy. He was like someone whose father and mother had suddenly died and just as suddenly had come back to life, Cunda's joy was this great.
復起禮佛，而說偈言： 「快哉獲己利， 善得於人身， 蠲除貪恚等， 永離三惡道。	He rose again, bowed ceremoniously before the Buddha, and then spoke in verse: Glad indeed am I, having gained the blessing, Of acquiring a human body [in this life]. Of allaying all trace of my greed, anger, and so forth, Of having forever left behind birth in the three unfortunate realms.
快哉獲己利， 遇得金寶聚， 值遇調御師， 不懼墮畜生。	Glad indeed am I, having gained the blessing Of acquiring a bevy of gold and jewels by chance. Of encountering a lord and protector, Of no longer fearing a fall into an animal rebirth.
佛如優曇花， 值遇生信難， 遇已種善根， 永離餓鬼苦， 亦復能損減， 阿修羅種類。	A buddha is like an udumbara flower, To encounter one and have faith is so difficult. Yet when there is that encounter, good roots are planted, Freeing one forever from the sufferings of the hungry ghost. And also effectively reducing Those born as asuras.
芥子投針鋒， 佛出難於是， 我以具足檀， 度人天生死。	Tossing a mustard seed on to the tip of a needle, Is not as difficult as a buddha appearing in the world. By completing the [perfection of] charity, I cross beyond the samsara of humans and gods.
佛不染世法， 如蓮花處水， 善斷有頂種， 永度生死流。	Not stained by mundane things (lokadharma), The Buddha is like a lotus flower standing in [muddy] water. Appropriately cutting off the seeds for even the highest birth, Crossing the stream of birth and death, forever.
生世為人難， 值佛世亦難， 猶如大海中， 盲龜遇浮孔。	To be born in this world as a human is difficult. To meet a buddha in this world is yet more difficult. It is like a blind turtle in the middle of the ocean, Finding a floating board with a hole [to put his head through]!
我今所奉食， 願得無上報， 一切煩惱結， 摧破不堅牢。	With this food that I have now offered, I hope to obtain the ultimate reward: May the fetters of all the defilements Be destroyed, never to grow strong again.
我今於此處， 不求天人身， 設使得之者， 心亦不甘樂。	As I stand here now, I do not seek a heavenly body. Even if I were to attain one, My heart would be unwilling to enjoy it.
如來受我供， 歡喜無有量， 猶如伊蘭花， 出於栴檀香。	For the Tathagata has accepted my offerings Such joy immeasurable! It is like the [foul-smelling] eranda flower Producing the fragrance of sandalwood.
我身如伊蘭， 如來受我供， 如出栴檀香， 是故我歡喜。	My body is like the eranda The Tathagata, who accepts my offering, Is like the wafting sandalwood fragrance.
我今得現報， 最勝上妙處， 釋梵諸天等， 悉來供養我。	This is why I am overjoyed, For here in this life, I have attained the most exalted reward. The gods Indra and Brahma, Come to make offerings to me!
一切諸世間， 悉生諸苦惱， 以知佛世尊， 欲入於涅槃。	Yet the entire world is distressed For they know the World-honored Buddha Is about to enter nirvana.
高聲唱是言， 世間無調御， 不應捨眾生， 應視如一子。	In a loud voice they cry: Imagine the world bereft of its lord and protector! Lord, do not abandon us living beings Look upon us as if we were your only son!
如來在僧中， 演說無上法， 如須彌寶山， 安處于大海。	When the Tathagata is among the sangha, Expounding the unsurpassed dharma, He is like a jeweled Mount Sumeru, Standing amid oceans.
佛智能善斷， 我等無明闇， 猶如虛空中， 起雲得清涼。	The Buddha's wisdom can effectively cut Through the darkness of our ignorance: When clouds cover the sky, It can get freezing cold,
如來能善除， 一切諸煩惱， 猶如日出時， 除雲光普照。	 But the Tathagata can effectively eliminate All our defilements, Just like the sun coming out Disperses the clouds and illuminates everything.
是諸眾生等， 啼泣面目腫， 悉皆為生死， 苦水之所漂。	These living beings Howl and cry, their faces swollen. As everyone drifts On the cruel waters of birth and death.
以是故世尊， 應長眾生信， 為斷生死苦， 久住於世間。」	For this reason, World-Honored One, To extend the faith of living beings And cut away their pain in samsara, You must remain long in this world!
佛告純陀：「如是如是，如汝所說。	The Buddha then said to Cunda: Just so, just so! Just as you have explained, the appearance of a buddha in the world is as rare as the udumbara flower.
佛出世難如優曇花，值佛生信亦復甚難，佛臨涅槃最後施食，能具足檀復倍甚難。	Meeting a buddha and having faith [in him] is also extremely difficult and rare. But providing the final offering of alms just as this buddha is facing nirvana-and thereby accomplishing the perfection of the practice of charity-is even more difficult and rare.
汝今純陀！莫大愁苦，應生踊躍，喜自慶幸，得值最後供養如來，成就具足檀波羅蜜，不應請佛久住於世。	Now Cunda, do not lament or grieve. Rather, you should be dancing with joy, rejoicing in your blessings to have been able to encounter this opportunity to present the final offering to a Tathagata, and therein complete the perfection of charity. You should not be asking the Buddha to remain any longer in the world.
汝今當觀諸佛境界，悉皆無常，諸行性相，亦復如是。	Instead you should contemplate the fact that everything in the realm where a buddha [operates] is impermanent, and that the characteristics of the nature of all conditioned phenomena are just like this as well.
即為純陀而說偈言： 「一切諸世間， 生者皆歸死， 壽命雖無量， 要必當有盡。	He then spoke to Cunda in verse: In every world What is born returns to death. Individual lifetimes, though uncountable in number, Must inevitably face their exhaustion. 
夫盛必有衰， 合會有別離， 壯年不久停， 盛色病所侵， 命為死所吞， 無有法常者。	Whatever flourishes will inevitably weaken. Any assembly has its dispersal. The prime of life stops before long. The beautiful flush of youth will be corrupted by illness. Life is swallowed by death. For there is no phenomenon that is permanent.
諸王得自在， 勢力無等雙， 一切皆遷動， 壽命亦如是。	Kings may [reign] as they please, With power unmatched, But everything undergoes change. A lifetime is also like this:
眾苦輪無際， 流轉無休息， 三界皆無常， 諸有無有樂。	A wheel of suffering, limitless In its transmigration, with nary a rest. In the triple world all is impermanent, All existence is without pleasure.
有道本性相， 一切皆空無， 可壞法流轉， 常有憂患等。	The original nature and characteristics of these paths of existence Are empty throughout. All these perishable dharmas flowing in and out, Eternally saddled with grief.
恐怖諸過惡， 老病死衰惱， 是諸無有邊， 易壞怨所侵。	The harmful errors of fear, The anxiety of aging, illness, death, and debilitation, These have no limit. [Health] is easily broken,[hearts] are invaded by resentment,
煩惱所纏裹， 猶如蠶處繭， 何有智慧者， 而當樂是處？	 Wrapped in defilements, [living beings] are Like silkworms inside their cocoons. What person of wisdom Would find pleasure in such a state?
此身苦所集， 一切皆不淨， 扼縛癰瘡等， 根本無義利。	This body, where pain and suffering is collected, Where everything is impure, Confined, subj ect to ulcers, and more, It is fundamentally without value.
上至諸天身， 皆亦復如是， 諸欲皆無常， 故我不貪著。	Even up through the bodies of those in the highest heavens, It is exactly the same. All desire is impermanent, So to the self one does not cling (sanga).
離欲善思惟， 而證於真實， 究竟斷有者， 今日當涅槃。	Freed of desire, with proper thinking One thus realizes Truth (moksa). Having completely cut all ties to [the great flow of] existence, Today will be my parinirvana.
我度有彼岸， 已得過諸苦， 是故於今者， 純受上妙樂。	When I crossed over to the other shore of existence, I went beyond all forms of suffering. For this reason, it is now That I graciously accept the wondrous bliss [of nirvana].
以是因緣故， 證無戲論邊， 永斷諸纏縛， 今日入涅槃。	By means of this causality I realize what is beyond all frivolous discourse, And cut off the binds of illusion, forever.
我無老病死， 壽命不可盡， 我今入涅槃， 猶如大火滅。	Today I enter nirvana There is no aging, illness, or death for me, For my lifespan cannot be exhausted. I now enter nirvana. Like the burning out of a great flame.
純陀汝不應， 思量如來義， 當觀如來住， 猶如須彌山。	Cunda, you should not speculate On the meaning of the Tathagata's [parinirvana]. Contemplate the Tathagata's abiding presence Like Mount Sumeru.
我今入涅槃， 受於第一樂， 諸佛法如是， 不應復啼哭。」	I now enter nirvana Acceding to the highest bliss. Thus is the nature of buddhas, You should weep no longer.
爾時純陀白佛言：	Then Cunda spoke to the Buddha, saying:
「世尊！如是如是，誠如聖教。	 World-Honored One. Just so, just so! Truly your sacred teaching is just as you say.
我今所有智慧微淺猶如蚊虻，何能思議如來涅槃深奧之義？ 世尊！	The wisdom I now possess is so trifling as to be nothing more than [that of] a mosquito or gnat-how could I ever conceive of c the deep, profound reasons for the Tathagata's nirvana? Ah, World Honored One!
我今已與諸大龍象菩薩摩訶薩，斷諸結漏文殊師利法王子等。 世尊！	Now, it may be that along with the bodhisattva-mahasattvas, like great dragons and elephants, I have now done away with the contaminants and stand equal to Manjusri, the dharma Prince.
譬如幼年初得出家，雖未受具即墮僧數。	But, World-Honored One, my case is like the example of a youth when he first enters the order: though he has yet to receive full ordination he is considered to be a member of a sangha.
我亦如是，以佛菩薩神通力故，得在如是大菩薩數。	It is only by means of the supernatural powers of the Buddha and the bodhisattvas that I have attained the position of being counted among these great bodhisattvas.
是故我今，欲令如來，久住於世，不入涅槃。	This is why I now want to have the Tathagata stay in the world for a long time without entering nirvana.
譬如飢人，終無變吐； 願使世尊亦復如是，常住於世，不入涅槃。」	Like a starving man with nothing left even to vomit, I still somehow hope to make the World-Honored One remain in this world forever, never to enter nirvana.
爾時文殊師利法王子告純陀言：	At that time Manjusri, the Dharma Prince, addressed Cunda:
「純陀！汝今不應發如是言，欲使如來常住於世，不般涅槃，如彼飢人無所變吐。	You should not speak in that way, trying to make the Tathagata stay in the world forever and so preventing his parinirvana, acting like a man so hungry he has nothing even to vomit. Instead you should be contemplating the nature and characteristics of all conditioned phenomena.
汝今當觀諸行性相，如是觀行具空三昧，欲求正法應如是學。」	Contemplate conditioned phenomena in this way and you will come to have a samadhi of emptiness. If you are seeking the true-dharma, you should apply yourself in this way.
純陀問言：	Cunda then asked:
「文殊師利！夫如來者，天上人中最尊最勝，如是如來，豈是行耶？ 若是行者，為生滅法。	Manjusri, the Tathagata is the most esteemed, most exalted one in the heavens and on earth. So how is it that the Tathagata is something conditioned?
譬如水泡，速起速滅，往來流轉，猶如車輪，一切諸行亦復如是。	If he were conditioned, he would be a dharma that arises and perishes, comparable to water bubbles that quickly arise and just as quickly disappear. The revolving cycle of going and coming [among conditioned phenomena] turns round and round like a wagon wheel. Everything conditioned follows the same pattern in this sense.
我聞諸天，壽命極長，云何世尊是天中天，壽命更促不滿百年？	I have heard that the lifetimes of the gods in the heavens are extremely long. How is it that the World-Honored One is said to be a god among gods, yet he ages so quickly, his lifetime lasting not even a hundred years?
如聚落主，勢得自在，以自在力，能制他人，是人福盡，其後貧賤，人所輕蔑，為他策使。	Think of the analogy of a village chieftain whose authority brings him freedom but who uses his power to oppress others. When his good fortune has run out, he will then be poor and miserable, disdained by the community and exploited by others.
所以者何？	Why does this happen?
失勢力故。	Because he has lost his power.
世尊亦爾，同於諸行，同諸行者，則不得稱為天中天。 何以故？	Could the World-Honored One be similarly the same as conditioned phenomena? If he were the same as conditioned phenomena, then he would not be called a god among gods. Why?
諸行即是生死法故。	Because everything conditioned is just a samsaric phenomenon.
是故文殊！ 勿觀如來同於諸行。	Therefore, Manjusri, do not consider the Tathagata to be the same as all the conditioned phenomena.
「復次文殊！為知而說、不知而說，而言如來同於諸行？	In addition, Manjusri, are you saying the Tathagata is the same as conditioned phenomena based on what you know, or are you saying this without really knowing?
設使如來同諸行者，則不得言於三界中，為天中天、自在法王。	If the Tathagata were the same as all conditioned phenomena, then he would not be deserving of the appellation, God Among Gods, Unencumbered Dharma King in the triple world.
譬如人王，有大力士，其力當千，更無有能降伏之者，故稱此人一人當千。 如是力士，王所愛念，偏賜爵祿，封賞自然。	Consider the analogy of a monarch who has a very powerful warrior. This man has the strength of a thousand men and there is no one who can defeat him, so they call him a man equal to a thousand. Cherished by the king, he is rewarded handsomely with nobility and emolument.
所以得稱當千人者，是人未必力敵於千，但以種種伎藝所能能勝千故，故稱當千。	The reason they call him equal to a thousand is not because his strength necessarily competes with that of a thousand people, but because he is able to defeat a thousand men by means of his various skills and techniques, both active and passive. This is why he is said to be equal to a thousand.
如來亦爾，降煩惱魔、陰魔、天魔、死魔，是故如來名三界尊，如彼力士一人當千。	The Tathagata is also like this. He defeats the demons that are the defilement-mara, the aggregate-mara, the heavenly maras, and the mara a of death. The Tathagata is therefore called Lord of the Triple World. Similar to that powerful warrior who is called a man equal to a thousand. By means of causal factors like these he is accomplished in various and uncountable genuine virtues.
以是因緣，成就具足種種無量真實功德，故稱如來、應、正遍知。 文殊師利！ 汝今不應憶想分別，以如來法同於諸行。	That is why he is called Thus Come, Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened. Manjusri, you should avoid the conceptual aberration that regards the dharma of the Tathagata as equivalent to conditioned phenomena.
譬如巨富長者生子，相師占之有短壽相。	What if there were a very rich man who produced a son but then learned from the divination of a fortune-teller that the son's life will be short.
父母聞已，知其不任紹繼家嗣，不復愛重，視如芻草。	Upon hearing this, the father and mother would understand that the son could not be designated the inheritor of the family estate.
夫短壽者，不為沙門、婆羅門等男女大小之所敬念。	They would lose their affectionate attachment to him, seeing him as if he were but grass, for a short life span is not respected by mendicants, brahmans, men, or women, whether adults or children.
若使如來同諸行者，亦復不為一切世間人天眾生之所奉敬，如來所說不變、不異、真實之法亦無受者。	If one were to say the Tathagata is identical to other conditioned phenomena, then he, too, would not be respected by humans, gods, or living beings in any world. The unchanging, undifferentiated true teaching that the Tathagata has expounded for us would not be accepted as well.
是故文殊！ 不應說言如來同於一切諸行。 「復次文殊！	This is why, Manjusri, you should not preach that the Tathagata's [existence] is identical to any form of conditioned phenomena.
譬如貧女，無有居家救護之者，加復病苦飢渴所逼，遊行乞丐，止他客舍，	In addition, Manjusri, consider the parable of a destitute woman with no place to stay and no one to take care of her, who also suffers from illness and is racked with hunger and thirst. Roaming about begging, she ends up staying in a house belonging to someone else. 
寄生一子，是客舍主驅逐令去。其產未久，携抱是兒，欲至他國。	There she gives birth to a child but when the master of the house [returns], he throws her out, forcing her to go away.So not long after giving birth she must carry her newborn in hopes of reaching another land.
於其中路，遇惡風雨，寒苦並至，多為蚊虻、蜂螫、毒蟲之所唼食，經由恒河，抱兒而度，其水漂疾而不放捨，於是母子遂共俱沒。	On the road she encounters a bad storm, bitter cold, and is stung by a host of mosquitoes, horseflies, and bees, and bitten by poisonous insects as well. Her journey brings her to the Ganges River, which she attempts to cross while holding her infant. [Trying to get her child to the other side,] no matter how swift the current, she will not let go; but in the end mother and child both drown.
如是女人慈念功德，命終之後，生於梵天。	This woman creates extraordinary merit in her compassion [toward her child], and after her life ends she is reborn in a Brahma heaven.
文殊師利！ 若有善男子欲護正法，勿說如來同於諸行、不同諸行！	Manjusri, if there is a good man who wants to protect the true-dharma, he should neither say that the Tathagata is the same as conditioned phenomena nor that he is not the same as conditioned phenomena.
唯當自責，我今愚癡，未有慧眼，如來正法不可思議。	What he should do is reproach himself with  am ignorant and do not yet have the eye of wisdom. The true-dharma of the Tathagata is inconceivable.
是故不應宣說，如來定是有為、定是無為。	Therefore it is improper to proclaim that the Tathagata is definitely created (samskrta) or definitely uncreated (asamskrta).
若正見者，應說如來定是無為。	But if there were a correct viewpoint in this, it would be most appropriate to say the Tathagata is definitely uncreated.
何以故？ 能為眾生生善法故、生憐愍故。 如彼貧女在於恒河，為愛念子而捨身命。 善男子！	Because for the sake of living beings he generates the good dharma and because he generates kindness, like the poor woman who sacrifices her own life in the Ganges out of love for her child.
護法菩薩亦應如是，寧捨身命，不說如來同於有為，當言如來同於無為。	Good man, bodhisattvas who protect the dharma should also do likewise. It would be better to throw away your life than to preach that the Tathagata is the same as created phenomena. You should instead say that the Tathagata is the same as that which is uncreated.
以說如來同無為故，得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提，如彼女人得生梵天。 何以故？	By preaching that the Tathagata is identical to the uncreated, you will attain anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. just like that woman attained birth in the Brahma Heaven.
以護法故。云何護法？	Because you would then be protecting the dharma.Precisely what is protecting the dharma?
所謂說言如來同於無為。	It is what am speaking about: preaching that the Tathagata is identical to the uncreated.
善男子！ 如是之人雖不求解脫，解脫自至； 如彼貧女，不求梵天，梵天自至。 文殊師利！	Good man, a person who does this will attain liberation even if he does not seek liberation, just as that the destitute woman attained the Brahma Heaven even though she did not seek the Brahma Heaven.
如人遠行，中路疲極，寄止他舍，臥寐之中，其室忽然大火卒起，即時驚寤，尋自思惟：『我於今者定死不疑。 』具慚愧故，以衣纏身，即便命終，生忉利天。	Manjusri, it is like someone traveling on a remote road who becomes exhausted and takes lodging in an unknown inn. While lying asleep, his room is suddenly engulfed in enormous flames. Suddenly startled from sleep, he immediately thinks No doubt I will surely die now. Filled with shame, he covers his body with his robes and presently dies, and is then reborn in the Trayastrimsa Heaven.
從是已後，滿八十返作大梵王，滿百千世生於人中為轉輪王，是人不復生三惡趣，展轉常生安樂之處。	After eighty more rebirths there, he becomes a Mahabrahma king, and after a hundred thousand lifetimes he is reborn as a wheel-turning sacred king (cakravartin). Never having to experience birth in any of the three unfortunate destinies (of hells, animals, and hungry ghosts), he is always born into a place of peace and happiness.
以是緣故，文殊師利！ 若善男子有慚愧者，不應觀佛同於諸行。 文殊師利！	For this reason, Manjusri, if there is a good man who feels shame [about his spiritual attainments], he must not identify the Buddha as one of the conditioned phenomena.
外道邪見可說如來同於有為，持戒比丘不應如是，於如來所生有為想。	Manjusri, the false views of a heretic may dictate that the Tathagata is identical to created phenomena, but a bhiksu who keeps the precepts should not conjecture that the identity of the Tathagata is created.
若言如來是有為者，即是妄語；	If one states that the Tathagata is created, that would be tantamount to lying.
當知是人死入地獄，如人自處於己舍宅。 文殊師利！	You should understand that such a person enters hell after he dies, just as if he were standing in his own house.
如來真實是無為法，不應復言是有為也。	Manjusri, the Tathagata is truly an uncreated dharma You should no longer say otherwise.
汝從今日於生死中，應捨無智，求於正智，當知如來即是無為。	From this day forth, while in samsara you must abandon your ignorance and seek correct wisdom, understanding that the Tathagata is indeed uncreated.
若能如是觀如來者，具足當得三十二相，速疾成就阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。」	If you can perceive the Tathagata in this way, you will become fully endowed with the thirty-two special marks [of an enlightened being] and quickly attain anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.
爾時文殊師利法王子讚純陀言：「善哉，善哉！	Then Manjusri, the Dharma Prince, praised Cunda:
善男子！	Excellent!
汝今已作長壽因緣，能知如來是常住法、不變異法、無為之法。	Excellent! Good man, you have now created the karmic conditions for a long life, fully understanding that the Tathagata is a permanently abiding dharma, an unchanging dharma, and an uncreated dharma.
汝今如是善覆如來有為之相，如彼火人，為慚愧故以衣覆身，以是善心生忉利天，復為梵王、轉輪聖王，不至惡趣，常受安樂。	In this way you have now successfully overturned the [notion of] the Tathagata as having the characteristics of that which is created. Your act is like the man exposed to fire who threw his robe over his body because he felt ashamed and who, by means of this exemplary state of mind, was reborn in the Trayastrimsa Heaven, again as Mahabrahma, and again as a wheel-turning sacred king, never again going into the lower realms of existence, always receiving births of peace and happiness.
汝亦如是，善覆如來有為相故，於未來世必定當得三十二相、八十種好、十八不共法、無量壽命，不在生死、常受安樂，不久得成應、正遍知。	Because you are also like him in the excellent way you have overturned the notion of the Tathagata as having the characteristics of created existences, in the future you will most assuredly attain the thirty-two major and eighty minor marks, as well as the eighteen distinctive characteristics of a buddha.! With an immeasurably long life, you will no longer experience the cycle of birth and death as such, but will remain in a state of peace and happiness, from which you will attain arhatship and full enlightenment before long.
純陀！ 如來次後自當廣說，我之與汝，俱亦當覆如來有為。	Cunda, the Tathagata presently will elaborate this point in detail and together you and I shall overturn the notion of the Tathagata as created.
有為、無為且共置之，汝可隨時速施飯食，如是施者，諸施中最。	So let us put aside this issue of created and uncreated for the moment. But you should serve food quickly when the situation requires it. Charity such as this is the best among all types of charity.
若比丘、比丘尼、優婆塞、優婆夷，遠行疲極，所須之物，應當清淨，隨時給與。	For these monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen are exhausted from their long journey. They require something clean and pure and you should try to provide this as needed.
如是速施，即是具足檀波羅蜜根本種子。	Responding quickly with charity like this is the fundamental seed of completing the perfection of charity.
純陀！若有最後施佛及僧，若多、若少、若足、不足，宜速及時，如來正爾當般涅槃。」	Cunda, as you are the last one to provide alms for the Buddha and the sangha, whatever it is you give, be it plentiful, trivial, adequate, or inadequate, do try to be quick about it. For the Tathagata is just about to assume parinirvana.
純陀答言：	Cunda then responded:
「文殊師利！汝今何故，貪為此食，而言多少、足與不足，令我時施？	Manjusri, why are you obsessed with this meal-talking about the food being plentiful or trivial, adequate or inadequate, and making sure that I provide things on time?
文殊師利！如來昔日苦行六年，尚自支持，況於今日須臾間耶？	Manjusri, in the olden days the Tathagata underwent asceticism for six years and yet sustained himself. Why wouldn't he be able to endure for a few more moments today?
文殊師利！ 汝今實謂如來正覺受斯食耶？	Manjusri, are you actually saying that the Tathagata in his perfect enlightenment will partake of this food?
然我定知，如來身者，即是法身，非為食身。」	For I definitely know the body of the Tathagata is none other than a body of dharma and not a body [that is sustained by] food.
爾時佛告文殊師利：「如是如是，如純陀言。	 At this point the Buddha spoke up and said to Manjusri: Just so, just so! It is just as Cunda has said.
善哉，純陀！	Excellent, Cunda!
汝已成就微妙大智，善入甚深大乘經典。」	You have already attained a wisdom great and subtle, skillfully penetrating the extremely profound Mahayana sutras.
文殊師利語純陀言：「汝謂如來是無為者，如來之身即是長壽；	Manjusri then said to Cunda: You describe the Tathagata as uncreated and the Tathagata's body as having a very long life.
若作是知，佛所悅可。」	Whenever one can produce such understanding the Buddha will be favorably disposed toward him.
純陀答言：「如來非獨悅可於我，亦復悅可一切眾生。」	Cunda answered: The Tathagata is not only favorably disposed toward me, he is favorably disposed toward all living beings.
文殊師利言：「如來於汝及以於我、一切眾生皆悉悅可。」	 Manjusri then said: You, me, and all living beings-the Tathagata is favorably disposed toward everyone. Cunda answered:
純陀答言：「汝不應言如來悅可。	You should not say the Tathagata is favorably disposed, for the very idea of him being favorably disposed is wrongheaded (viparita-samjna).
夫悅可者，則是倒想。 若有倒想，則是生死。 有生死者，即有為法。	Such false concepts are samsaric, and everything in samsara is created.
是故文殊！ 勿謂如來是有為也。	Therefore, Manjusri, do not refer to the Tathagata as created.
若言如來是有為者，我與仁者俱行顛倒。	If we allude to the Tathagata as created, then you and I are both committing acts of distortion.
文殊師利！ 如來無有愛念之想。	Manjusri, the Tathagata has no notion of affectionate love.
夫愛念者，如彼母牛愛念其子，雖復飢渴行求水草，若足、不足，忽然還歸。	By affectionate love I am referring to the way a cow loves her calf: even when she is out in search of water or grass because she is thirsty or hungry, she may suddenly return home [when she thinks of her calf] regardless of whether or not she has satisfied her own needs.
諸佛世尊無有是念，等視一切如羅睺羅。	Buddhas, world-honored ones, do not have such thoughts. They look upon all [living beings] as Rahula.
如是念者，即是諸佛智慧境界。 	It is precisely the realm of the buddhas' wisdom [and not in samsara] where thoughts such as this occur.
文殊師利！譬如國王，調御駕駟，欲令驢車而及之者，無有是處。	Manjusri, this is analogous to a team of horses specially trained by the king. Though we may want to empower our donkey cart to reach that level, it makes no sense to expect such a thing.
我與仁者亦復如是，欲盡如來微密深奧，亦無是處。	You and I are also like this. Much as we may want to see the entirety of the hidden, profound depths of the Tathagata, this is unreasonable.
文殊師利！如金翅鳥飛昇虛空無量由旬，下觀大海悉見水性魚鼈、黿鼉、龜龍之屬，及見己影，如於明鏡見諸色像。	Manjusri, it is like a garuda soaring into the sky for countless yojanas. He looks down into the ocean and sees families of water creatures such as fish, soft-shelled turtles, sea turtles, and other turtles, crocodiles, and serpents; he even sees his own reflection appearing like an obj ect in a bright mirror.
凡夫少智，不能籌量如是所見，我與仁者亦復如是，不能籌量如來智慧。」	With their limited understanding, ordinary persons cannot fathom what that bird sees. You and I are also like this: we cannot fathom the wisdom of a Tathagata.
文殊師利語純陀言：「如是如是，如汝所說。	Manjusri addressed Cunda: Just so, just so! It is just as you have explained.
我於此事，非為不達，直欲試汝諸菩薩事。」	It is not that I had not discerned this; I merely wanted to test you in the affairs of a bodhisattva.
爾時世尊從其面門出種種光，其光明曜，照文殊身。	Just then the World-Honored One emitted a variegated light from between his eyebrows, illuminating the body of Manjusri.
文殊師利遇斯光已，即知是事，尋告純陀：「如來今者現是瑞相，不久必當入於涅槃。	Upon encountering this light, Manjusri understood what it was. He then spoke to Cunda: As the Tathagata has manifested this propitious sign, he will surely be entering nirvana before too long.
汝先所設最後供養，宜時奉獻佛及大眾。	These last offerings that you have prepared must be presented to the Buddha and the assembly in a timely manner.
純陀當知，如來放是種種光明，非無因緣。」	You do understand that the Tathagata does not shine forth this type of multicolored light without a reason.
純陀聞已，情塞默然。	Upon hearing this, his emotions in check, Cunda grew quiet.
佛告純陀：「汝所奉施佛及大眾，今正是時，如來正爾當般涅槃。」	The Buddha then said to Cunda: Now is the proper time to make your offerings to the Buddha and the assembly.The Tathagata is about to assume parinirvana.
第二、第三亦復如是。	 He spoke in this manner a second and then a third time.
爾時純陀聞佛語已，舉聲啼哭，悲咽而言：「苦哉，苦哉，世間空虛。」	After hearing the Buddha speak in this way, Cunda finally cried aloud, choked with sadness: How awful, how distressing! The world will be empty!
復白大眾：「我等今者一切當共五體投地，同聲勸佛莫般涅槃。」	He then turned to the assembly and said, We should all prostrate ourselves on the ground right now and with one voice urge the Buddha not to pass into parinirvana!
爾時世尊復告純陀：「莫大啼哭，令心顦悴。	At that point the World-Honored One spoke again to Cunda: Do not carry on like that-you will harm yourself.
當觀是身，猶如芭蕉、熱時之炎、水泡、幻化、乾闥婆城、坏器、電光，亦如畫水、臨死之囚、熟果段肉，如織經盡，如碓上下，當觀諸行，猶雜毒食，有為之法，多諸過患。」	You must consider the fact that this body is like a banana tree, a mirage in hot weather, a water bubble, a hallucination, an imaginary construct, an illusory city floating in the air conjured up by gandharvas, an unfired pot, or a flash of lightning. It is like drawing something on water, a prisoner facing death, ripe fruit, or cut meat; like the warp thread running out on a loom, like the up and down motion when grinding in a mortar as well. You should ponder the fact that all compounded things are like so much poisoned food, that there is much misery in conditioned phenomena.
於是純陀復白佛言：「如來不欲久住於世，我當云何而不啼泣？	To which Cunda replied to the Buddha: The Tathagata does not wish to remain long in this world. How can I not cry?
苦哉，苦哉，世間空虛。	This is terrible, distressing! The world will be empty.
唯願世尊，憐愍我等及諸眾生，久住於世，勿般涅槃。」	All I ask, World-Honored One, is that you take pity on us here and indeed on all living beings and remain with us for some time. Do not pass into parinirvana!
佛告純陀：「汝今不應發如是言，憐愍我故，久住於世。	The Buddha said to Cunda:You should not say things like, Take pity on us and remain in the world longer. 
我以憐愍汝及一切，是故今欲入於涅槃。	I have pity for you, indeed for everyone. That is precisely why I am now about to enter nirvana.
何以故？	What is this?
諸佛法爾，有為亦然。	This is the nature of buddhas, just as it is for created phenomena as well.
是故諸佛而說偈言： 『有為之法， 其性無常。	This is why buddhas utter the verse: All created things Have natures impermanent.
生已不住， 寂滅為樂。 』	After coming into existence, they do not abide. Tranquil extinction is bliss.
純陀！汝今當觀一切行雜諸法，無我、無常、不住，此身多有無量過患，猶如水泡，是故汝今不應啼泣。」	Cunda, you should contemplate how all compounded things are mixed with the dharmas of nonself, impermanence, and nonabiding. This body, with its innumerable forms of misery, is like foam on the surface of b water. For this reason, you should not cry now.
爾時純陀復白佛言：「如是如是，誠如尊教。	Then Cunda said to the Buddha: Just so, just so. It is indeed as the Lord teaches.
雖知如來方便示現入於涅槃，而我不能不懷苦惱，覆自思惟，復生慶悅。」	Although I am aware that the Tathagata's entering into nirvana is an expression of expediency (upaya), yet I am still unable to dispel my grief. On the other hand, when I ponder the matter, I also have feelings of joy.
佛讚純陀：「善哉，善哉！	The Buddha praised Cunda: Excellent! Excellent!
能知如來示同眾生，方便涅槃。 純陀！	You have understood well that the Tathagata manifests his nirvana of expediency for all living beings.
汝今當聽，如娑羅娑鳥，春陽之月皆共集彼阿耨達池。 諸佛亦爾，皆至是處。	Cunda, listen to me now. Just as the sarasa cranes flock to Lake Anavatapta in the months of spring, so do the buddhas all come to this place.
純陀！ 汝今不應思惟諸佛長壽短壽，一切諸法皆如幻相，如來在中以方便力無所染著。 何以故？	Cunda, you must not now deliberate over whether the lives of buddhas are long or short. All conditioned dharmas are like illusory forms, and while a tathagata is among them he is using his powers of skillful means to do so but he is never tainted by them.
諸佛法爾。	Because this is the nature of buddhas.
純陀！ 我今受汝所獻供養，為欲令汝度於生死諸有流故。	Cunda, I now accept the offerings you present because I want to enable you to cross over the streams of existence that are samsara.
若諸人、天於此最後供養我者，悉皆當得不動果報，常受安樂。	If all humans and deities made offerings to me in this final moment, each of them would attain the karmic reward of imperturbability, which is to be eternally blessed with peace and happiness.
何以故？我是眾生良福田故。	Why would this happen? Because I am a most excellent field of blessing for living beings.
汝若復欲為諸眾生作福田者，速辦所施，不宜久停。」	If you also want to become a field of blessings for living beings, then quickly present your offerings; do not tarry.
爾時純陀，為諸眾生得度脫故，低頭飲淚而白佛言：	So that living beings may attain liberation, Cunda then lowered his head, swallowed his tears, and said to the Buddha:
我若堪任為福田時，則能了知如來涅槃及非涅槃。「善哉，世尊！	Excellent, World-Honored One! If I am worthy, when I become a field of merit I will be able to comprehend the Tathagata's nirvana and his nonnirvana.
我等今者及諸聲聞、緣覺智慧猶如蚊蟻，實不能量如來涅槃及非涅槃。」	But at the moment the wisdom possessed by myself and indeed all the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas is little more than that of mosquitoes or ants. We truly cannot fathom the nirvana-or even the nonnirvana-of the Tathagata.
爾時純陀及其眷屬，愁憂啼泣，圍遶如來，燒香散花，盡心敬奉。	At that time Cunda and his followers, feeling forlorn and agitated, circumambulated the Tathagata even as they wept. They burned incense and scattered flowers, paying homage [to the Buddha] with utter sincerity.
尋與文殊從座而去，供辦食具。	Then, together with Manjusri, they left their seats to prepare the meal provisions.
其去未久，是時此地六種震動，乃至梵世亦復如是。	It was not long after they had left their seats that the earth shook in six different ways, reaching all the way up to the Brahma Heaven, where it was also felt.
地動有二，或有地動，或大地動。	There are two kinds of such things: earthquakes and major earthquakes.
小動者名為地動，大動者名大地動。 有小聲者名曰地動，有大聲者名大地動。 獨地動者名曰地動，山河樹木及大海水一切動者，名大地動。	Small tremors are simply called earthquakes but when there is significant movement it is referred to as a major earthquake. Likewise, when the sound associated with these occurrences is small, the event is called an earthquake but when the sound is loud one also speaks of a major earthquake. If only the ground moves, that is an earthquake, but if mountains, rivers, trees, and waters in the ocean move-when everything moves-then it is called a major earthquake.
