稽首唯識性，滿分清淨者。	Homage I render homage to those purified wholly or in part through consciousness only.
我今釋彼說，利樂諸有情。	I shall explain what has been said for the benefit and joy of beings.
今造此論，為於二空有迷謬者生正解故。	Vasubandhu composed the Treatise Thirty Verses for those who are deluded about or deny the two kinds of emptiness, so that they may arouse correct understanding.
生解為斷二重障故，由我法執二障具生，若證二空彼障隨斷。	Correct understanding means eliminating the two heavy obstacles. These two obstacles arise as a result of attachment to a self and dharmas. By realizing the two kinds of emptiness, the obstacles are removed, 
斷障為得二勝果故，由斷續生煩惱障故證真解脫，由斷礙解所知障故得大菩提。	and by removing the two obstacles, one obtains two excellent results:by eliminating the obstacle of passions that lead to rebirth, one realizes true liberation; by eliminating the obstacle to the knowable that hinders true understanding, one obtains great awakening.
又為開示謬執我法迷唯識者，令達二空，於唯識理如實知故。	Also, Vasubandhu composed the Treatise to instruct those who are attached to a self and dharmas and who are deluded about consciousness only, to permit them to reach the two kinds of emptiness and really comprehend the principle of consciousness only. 
復有迷謬唯識理者，或執外境如識非無、或執內識如境非有、或執諸識用別體同、或執離心無別心所，為遮此等種種異執，令於唯識深妙理中得如實解，故作斯論。	Some are deluded about this principle of consciousness only. Some grasp the external world as not nonexistent, like consciousness. Some grasp internal consciousness as nonexistent, like the external world. Some grasp the various kinds of consciousness as being the same in substance but different in characteristics. Some believe that there are no separate mental functions apart from the mind. This Treatise was composed in order to refute these views and to allow people to acquire a correct understanding of the profound and wonderful principle of consciousness only.
若唯有識，云何世間及諸聖教說有我法？	If nothing exists but consciousness, why do ordinary people and holy teachings say that selves and dharmas exist? 
頌曰：由假說我法，   有種種相轉，   彼依識所變，   此能變唯三，  謂異熟思量，   及了別境識。	The Thirty Verses says, the metaphor of self and dharmas evolves in various ways upon the transformation of consciousness. the transforming consciousness is threefold: retribution, thought, and perception of the external realm.
論曰：世間聖教說有我法，但由假立，非實有性。	The Treatise says that ordinary people and holy teachings say that selves and dharmas exist; but they do not really exist, because they are only metaphors.
我謂主宰，法謂軌持，彼二俱有種種相轉。	Self means a controlling power. Dharmas are rules. These take different forms.
我種種相，謂有情命者等、預流一來等。	Various forms of selves include such things as being and living being, and such things as stream winner and once returner.
法種種相，謂實德業等、蘊處界等。	Various forms of dharmas are such things as substance, quality, karma, aggregates, sense bases, and sense fields.
轉謂隨緣施設有異。	evolves means that these distinctions occur in accordance with conditions.
如是諸相若由假說，依何得成？	If these forms are based on metaphors, how can they be established?
彼相皆依識所轉變而假施設。	These forms are all metaphorical constructions based on the transformations of consciousness.
識謂了別，此中識言亦攝心所，定相應故。	consciousness means perception. Here, in the Treatise, the word consciousness also Ii, includes mental activities, because they are without doubt associated with the former.
變謂識體轉似二分，相、見俱依自證起故。	transformation means that the substance of consciousness evolves to resemble two parts, because these two parts, consisting of internal images and perception arise on the basis of the self authenticating nature of consciousness.
依斯二分施設我法，彼二離此無所依故。	Self and dharmas originate from these two parts, because these two images have no support other than these two parts.
或復內識轉似外境，我法分別熏習力故，諸識生時變似我法，此我法相雖在內識，而由分別似外境現。	Internal consciousness evolves resembling an external realm. As a result of the power of impressions Wu sand from imagining a self and dharmas, when the consciousnesses are born, they change into a self and dharmas. Even though the images of this self and dharmas are within consciousness, still, due to imagination, they appear to be external.
諸有情類無始時來，緣此執為實我實法，如患夢者患夢力故，心似種種外境相現，緣此執為實有外境。	From beginningless time, sentient beings consider them to be real selves and dharmas as a result of this grasping. One is like a dreamer whose mind, because of the power of the dream, appears in the form of various external things and who consequently considers them to be really external things.
愚夫所計實我實法都無所有，但隨妄情而施設故，說之為假。	None of these selves and dharmas that the foolish believe in really exist. They are said to be metaphors because they are based on nothing but false delusions.
內識所變似我似法，雖有而非實我法性，然似彼現故說為假。	Even though these apparent selves and apparent dharmas that are evolutions of consciousness exist, they are not real selves and dharmas. However, they are like manifestations and for that reason are said to be metaphors.
外境隨情而施設故，非有如識；	An external realm is established on the basis of delusion and hence does not really exist in the same way that consciousness does.
內識必依因緣生故，非無如境，由此便遮增減二執。	Inner consciousness is necessarily generated from causes and conditions and therefore is not nonexistent in the same way that external objects are. In this way, the two extremes of increase and decrease are avoided.
境依內識而假立故，唯世俗有；	The external object is based on internal consciousness and therefore only exists from a worldly point of view.
識是假境所依事故，亦勝義有。	Consciousness is the basis for the conventionally established realm and therefore exists in ultimate truth.
云何應知實無外境唯有內識似外境生？	How do we know that the external world does not really exist but that there is an internal consciousness that is born resembling external objects?
實我實法不可得故。	Because a real self and dharmas cannot be found.
如何實我不可得耶？	Why can a real self not be found?
諸所執我略有三種：	There are, in short, three theories of what a self is.
一者執我體常周遍量同虛空，隨處造業受苦樂故。	The first is that the self is eternal, universal, and extended like space. In all situations, it performs actions and experiences pleasure and pain.
二者執我其體雖常而量不定，隨身大小有卷舒故。	The second theory is that the self that is grasped is eternal but that it has no fixed extension, because it expands and contracts according to the body's size.
三者執我體常至細如一極微，潛轉身中作事業故。	The third theory is that the self is eternal but extremely small, like an atom. It resides hidden in the body, where it moves about and performs actions.
初且非理。 所以者何？	The first theory is unreasonable. Why?
執我常遍量同虛空，應不隨身受苦樂等。	A self that is eternal, universal, and extended like space could not feel pain and pleasure through the body.
又常遍故應無動轉，如何隨身能造諸業？	And if it is eternal and universal, like space, it cannot move, so how could it perform actions through the body?
又所執我，一切有情為同為異？	Also, is the self the same for all sentient beings or is it different?
若言同者，一作業時一切應作，一受果時一切應受，一得解脫時一切應解脫，便成大過。	If it is the same for all, then when one being performs an action, all must perform it, and when one being experiences the results of action, all must experience it. If one being obtains liberation, all must obtain it. This is a big mistake!
若言異者，諸有情我更相遍故，體應相雜。	If, on the other hand, you claim that each being has a distinct self, then the selves of beings must merge together and their substances must be mixed.
又一作業一受果時，與一切我處無別故，應名一切所作所受。	Also, when one acts and experiences the results, then all must act and receive the results, since all selves occupy the same place.
若謂作受各有所屬無斯過者，理亦不然，業果及身與諸我合，屬此非彼不應理故。	If you claim that the action or result of action of beings is distinct and peculiar to the individual, and thus no error occurs, this is not reasonable, because action, result, and body must be united with all selves. It makes no sense that they belong to one and not another.
一解脫時一切應解脫，所修證法一切我合故。	When one obtains liberation, all must obtain it, because the Dharma practiced and realized would be merged with all selves.
中亦非理。 所以者何？	The second theory is likewise unreasonable. Why?
我體常住，不應隨身而有舒卷。 既有舒卷，如槖籥風，應非常住。	If the substance of the self is eternal, it cannot expand and contract in the body, because, expanding and contracting like a bellows, it must not be eternal.
又我隨身應可分析，如何可執我體一耶？	Also, if selves correspond to bodies, they must be divisible, so how can the substance of a self be unitary?
故彼所言如童竪戲。	Consequently, this theory is simply childish nonsense. 
後亦非理。 所以者何？	The third theory is also unreasonable. Why?
我量至小如一極微，如何能令大身遍動？	If the self is as small as an atom, how can it make a large body move?
若謂雖小而速巡身如旋火輪似遍動者，則所執我非一非常，諸有往來非常一故。	If you claim that even though it is small, it travels through the body rapidly, moving like a whirling torch, then the self you are attached to is neither unitary nor eternal, because that which comes and goes is neither unitary nor eternal.
又所執我復有三種：一者即蘊、二者離蘊、三者與蘊非即非離。	There are also three other theories about selves: the self is identical with the aggregates; it is different; it is neither the same as nor different from the aggregates.
初即蘊我，理且不然，我應如蘊非常一故。	As for the first, it is not reasonable that the self is identical with the aggregates, because a self that is like the aggregates must not be eternal or unitary.
又內諸色定非實我，如外諸色有質礙故。	Moreover, internal forms are not a real self because, like external forms, they are substantial.
心心所法亦非實我，不恒相續待眾緣故。	Nor are mind and mental activities a real self, because they do not continue in an unbroken series but rather require a host of conditions to exist.
餘行餘色亦非實我，如虛空等非覺性故。	Nor are other forms of karmic predispositions a real self, because, like space, they are unaware.
中離蘊我，理亦不然，應如虛空無作受故。	The second theory, that the self is different from the aggregates, is also unreasonable, because I being formless like space, it can neither act nor experience the results of action.
後俱非我，理亦不然，許依蘊立非即離蘊，應如瓶等非實我故。	Finally, the third theory, that the self is neither the same as, nor different from, the aggregates, is also unreasonable, because by saying that the self is based on the aggregates but is neither identical with them nor different from them, the self would be something like a pot and not a real self.
又既不可說有為無為，亦應不可說是我非我，故彼所執實我不成。	Also, since it cannot be said that the self either acts or does not act, it cannot be said to be either a self or not a self. Therefore the real self that is grasped does not exist.
又諸所執實有我體，為有思慮、為無思慮？	Also, does this real self that is grasped think or not?
若有思慮，應是無常，非一切時有思慮故。	If it thinks, then it is not eternal, because thought does not take place at all times.
若無思慮，應如虛空，不能作業亦不受果。	If it does not think, then, like space, it cannot act or experience the results of action.
故所執我，理俱不成。	Therefore this self does not agree with reason.
又諸所執實有我體，為有作用、為無作用？	Also, does this self that is grasped act or not?
若有作用，如手足等，應是無常。	If it acts, then, like hands and feet, it is not eternal.
若無作用，如兔角等，應非實我。	If it does not act, then, like the horns of a rabbit, it must not be real.
故所執我，二俱不成。	Therefore both theories about the self are invalid.
又諸所執實有我體，為是我見所緣境不？	Also, is this truly existing self the object of the view of self or not?
若非我見所緣境者，汝等云何知實有我？	If it is not, how can you say that there is a truly existing self?
若是我見所緣境者，應有我見非顛倒攝，如實知故，	If it is the object of the view of self, then there must exist a view of self not included among the perverted views, because then it would be true knowledge.
若爾如何執有我者所信至教皆毀我見、稱讚無我，言無我見能證涅槃執著我見沈淪生死？	If that is the case, how do you explain the fact that the supreme doctrine of those who presumably advocate a real self all denounce the view of self and extol the view of no self, saying that those who see no self realize nirvana, while those who are attached to a view of self transmigrate in the realm of birth and death?
豈有邪見能證涅槃，正見翻令沈淪生死？	How can a person with a perverted view attain nirvana and one with a correct view transmigrate in the realm of birth and death?
又諸我見不緣實我，有所緣故，如緣餘心。	Moreover, none of the various views of a self has as an object a real self, because they all have objects no different from any object of the mind.
我見所緣定非實我，是所緣故，如所餘法。	The perceived object of the view of self is definitely not a real self, because it is an object, like any other object.
是故我見不緣實我，但緣內識變現諸蘊，隨自妄情種種計度。	One actually sees only the aggregates that evolve from consciousness and, in accordance with ones own delusions, interprets them in various ways.
然諸我執略有二種：一者俱生、二者分別。	Attachment to a self takes two forms: innate, and resulting from imagination.
俱生我執，無始時來虛妄熏習內因力故恒與身俱，不待邪教及邪分別任運而轉，故名俱生。	Due to the power of the inner causation of false perfuming that has existed since beginningless time, innate attachment is always present in the individual and does not depend on false teachings or imagination but rather occurs spontaneously. That is why it is said to be innate.
此復二種：一常相續在第七識，緣第八識起自心相執為實我。	It takes two forms. The first form of innate attachment is constant and continuous and resides in the seventh consciousness. It takes as an object the eighth consciousness and produces an image that is natural to the mind which it clings to as a self.
二有間斷，在第六識，緣識所變五取蘊相，或總或別起自心相執為實我。	The second form is intermittent and resides in the sixth consciousness. It takes as an object the images of the five aggregates that are grasped that evolve from consciousness, either individually or wholly, and produces an image that is natural to the mind which it clings to as a self.
此二我執細故難斷，後修道中數數修習勝生空觀方能除滅。	These two forms of attachment are subtle and difficult to eliminate. They are only eliminated at a later time on the path of cultivation through the repeated cultivation of the of the eminent contemplation of emptiness of the self.
分別我執亦由現在外緣力故非與身俱，要待邪教及邪分別然後方起，故名分別，唯在第六意識中有。	Attachment to a self resulting from imagination is the result of the power of present, external conditions and is therefore not innate. It derives from false doctrines and false imagination for its existence, hence the name imagination. It only exists in the sixth consciousness, or mano-vijñāna. 
此亦二種：一緣邪教所說蘊相，起自心相分別計度執為實我。	It also takes two forms. The first occurs when the sixth consciousness takes as an object images of the aggregates discussed in a false teaching, produces an image that is natural to the mind, and, through imagination and speculation, clings to it as a real self.
二緣邪教所說我相，起自心相分別計度執為實我。	The second has as its object the image of a self spoken of in a false teaching, produces an image that is natural to the mind, and clings to it as a real self.
此二我執麁故易斷。	These two kinds of attachment are gross and therefore easy to eliminate.
初見道時，觀一切法生空真如即能除滅。	When one first enters the path of insight, one contemplates true reality as the natural emptiness of all dharmas and eliminates this attachment.
如是所說一切我執，自心外蘊或有或無，自心內蘊一切皆有，是故我執皆緣無常五取蘊相妄執為我。	Thus all these attachments to a self exist in connection with aggregates within the mind but not to aggregates external to mind. They always exist in connection with aggregates internal to mind. Therefore attachment is always wholly directed to the images of the five aggregates that are clung to, which are erroneously grasped as a self.
然諸蘊相從緣生故是如幻有，妄所執我橫計度故決定非有。	However, the images of the aggregates are wholly produced from conditions and therefore have an illusory existence. The self that is falsely grasped is an unreasonable speculation and therefore definitely is nonexistent.
故契經說：苾芻當知，世間沙門婆羅門等所有我見，一切皆緣五取蘊起。	Therefore a scripture says, You should know, monks, that the view of a self of the Brahmins and sramanas originates in the five aggregates that are grasped.
實我若無，云何得有憶識誦習恩怨等事？	It may be asked, if there is no self, how do you account for such things as recollection, perception, repetition, volition, anger, and so forth?
所執實我既常無變，後應如前是事非有，前應如後是事非無，以後與前體無別故。	We reply that if the self that is grasped is eternal and unchanging, it must be the same before and after, and hence recollection must not exist. Also, if it is the same before as it is after, then recollection, etc., must already exist in the prior state, because its substance would be the same in prior and subsequent states.
若謂我用前後變易非我體者，理亦不然，用不離體應常有故，	If it is claimed that although the function of the self changes from state to state the substance remains unchanged, this is unreasonable, because function is not separate from substance and therefore should always exist.
體不離用應非常故。	Also, if substance does not differ from function, it must not be constant. 
然諸有情各有本識，一類相續任持種子，與一切法更互為因，熏習力故，得有如是憶識等事。	However, all sentient beings possess a fundamental consciousness that is homogeneous, continuous, and contains seeds of all dharmas. This consciousness and all dharmas act upon each other, and due to the power of perfuming (vasana), such things as recollection, perception, etc., can exist. 
故所設難，於汝有失，非於我宗。 若無實我，誰能造業、誰受果耶？	Therefore difficulties concerning recollection, etc., are in your tenets, not in ours. Or it may be asked, if there is no real self, who performs acts and experiences the results of action? 
所執實我既無變易，猶如虛空，如何可能造業受果？若有變易，應是無常。 然諸有情心心所法，因緣力故相續無斷，造業受果，於理無違。	We reply, since the self that you grasp is said to be unchanging, it is like space. How could it perform actions and experience the results? If, on the other hand, it does change, it must not be eternal. However, because of the power of causes and conditions of the minds and mental activities of sentient beings, the performance of action and experience of results continues without cessation, and so there is no contradiction with reason. 
我若實無，誰於生死輪迴諸趣？ 誰復厭苦求趣涅槃？	Or it may be asked, if the self is really nonexistent, who transmigrates being born and dying in the various planes of existence? Who has a distaste for suffering and seeks nirvana? 
所執實我既無生滅，如何可說生死輪迴？	We reply, since the self that you grasp is itself birthless and deathless, how can you say that it transmigrates in the realm of birth and death?
常如虛空，非苦所惱，何為厭捨求趣涅槃？	Your self must resemble space. It is not tormented by suffering, so how can it detest suffering and seek nirvana?
故彼所言，常為自害。	Thus your claim turns upon itself in self contradiction.
然有情類身心相續，煩惱業力輪迴諸趣，厭患苦故求趣涅槃。	Sentient beings are continuous series of psychical and physical states, and by the power of passions and actions, these series turn toward various planes of existence. Because they are tormented by suffering, they seek nirvana.
由此故知定無實我。	As a consequence of this, you should realize that there is no real self, only various consciousnesses.
但有諸識無始時來前滅後生因果相續，由妄熏習似我相現，愚者於中妄執為我。	From beginningless time, the former mental state disappears and a succeeding state appears, and thus there is a continuous series of causes and results. As a result of false perfuming by false notions, something resembling a self appears. The foolish mistake what is falsely grasped for a real self.
如何識外實有諸法不可得耶？	Why is it that apart from consciousness, no real dharmas can be found?
外道餘乘所執外法，理非有故。	Because the real dharmas grasped by non Buddhists and other vehicles of Buddhism do not exist from the standpoint of reason.
外道所執云何非有？	Why are those grasped by non-Buddhists nonexistent?
且數論者執我是思，受用薩埵、刺闍、答摩所成大等二十三法。	The Sāṃkhyas believe in a self that is intelligent and that uses twenty three dharmas, such as Mahat, etc., which in turn are composed of the three qualities of rajas, sattva, and tamas.
然大等法三事合成，是實非假，現量所得。	Although composed of the three qualities, Mahat, etc., are real and not fictitious, and are known by direct perception.
彼執非理。 所以者何？	This tenet is unreasonable. Why?
大等諸法多事成故，如軍林等，應假非實，如何可說現量得耶？	Because Mahat, etc., are made up of a plurality of things, like an army or forest, and are therefore fictitious. How can it be claimed that they are known by direct perception?
又大等法若是實有，應如本事非三合成。	Moreover, if Mahat, etc., are real, they must not be composed of the three qualities of sattva, etc., just as the latter themselves are not so composed.
薩埵等三即大等故，應如大等亦三合成。	Since the three qualities, sattva, etc., are the same as Mahat, etc., then like Mahat, etc., they ought to be composed of the three.
轉變非常，為例亦爾。	By analogy, since they change, they are not eternal.
又三本事各多功能，體亦應多。	Also, the three elements of sattva, etc., act in many ways and therefore should have multiple substances, since there is no difference between substance and function.
能體一故，三體既遍，一處變時餘亦應爾，體無別故。	Also, since the three sub stances are all pervasive, then when they change in one place, they should change elsewhere, because their substances are not distinct.
許此三事體相各別，如何和合共成一相？	If it is admitted that the substance and characteristics of the three elements are different, how can they combine and create a single characteristic I such as firmness, etc.?
不應合時變為一相，與未合時體無別故。	They must not be able to create a single characteristic when they combine, because then their substance is no different from what it was prior to combination.
若謂三事體異相同，便違己宗體相是一。	If it is claimed that the substance of the three elements differs but the characteristics are the same, this is self contradictory, because you claim that substance and characteristics are the same.
體應如相冥然是一，相應如體顯然有三，故不應言三合成一。	Substance must be like character, obscurely one and the same. Character must be like substance, obviously threefold. Therefore it cannot be claimed that three elements combine to form a single thing.
又三是別，大等是總，總別一故，應非一三。	Also, the three elements are all distinct, while Mahat, etc., are all synthetic I compounds of the three elements I. Since the particulars and their compounds are the same, they can be neither one thing nor three.
此三變時若不和合成一相者，應如未變，如何現見是一色等？	If the three elements do not combine and form a unity when they change, they must remain the same as before the change. How then could they be perceived as a single color, etc.?
若三和合成一相者，應失本別相，體亦應隨失。	If the three elements do combine and form a single characteristic, they lose their respective unique characteristics and accordingly lose their own substances.
不可說三各有二相，一總二別；	Nor can it be said that each of the three elements has a dual character, a particular character and a general one.
總即別故，總亦應三，如何見一？	Since the particular and general are the same, the general will be threefold, so how can a unity be perceived?
若謂三體各有三相，和雜難知故見一者。 既有三相，寧見為一？	If it is claimed that the substance of each element has three characteristics, but that it is difficult to distinguish the combined mixture, so that they appear as a unity, then since there are three characteristics, how do they appear as a unity?
復如何知三事有異？	Again, how do we know that each of the three is different?
若彼一一皆具三相，應一一事能成色等，何所闕少待三和合？	If each element possesses three characteristics, then each must be able to create a color or the like, so why is it necessary for the three elements to unite?
體亦應各三，以體即相故。又大等法皆三合成，展轉相望應無差別，是則因果唯量諸大，諸根差別皆不得成。	Also, since characteristics and substance are identical, then the substance of each element must be tripartite, and since Mahat and the others are each composed of the three elements, there will be no difference when they evolve. Thus there will be no difference between cause and effect, gross and subtle elements, sense faculties, etc.
若爾，一根應得一切境，或應一境一切根所得。	In that case, one sense organ will perceive all objects, or one kind of object will be perceived by all the different organs.
世間現見情與非情、淨穢等物，現比量等皆應無異，便為大失。	Though the world sees them as different, the animate and inanimate, pure and impure, direct perception and inference, etc., would not be different. This would be a huge confusion.
故彼所執實法不成，但是妄情計度為有。	Therefore the real dharmas of the Sāṃkhyas do not exist, although false notions and speculation take them to be real.
勝論所執實等句義多實有性，現量所得。	The Vaiśeṣikas believe in many categories, such as substance, which really exist and which are known by direct perception.
彼執非理。 所以者何？	This doctrine is untenable. Why?
諸句義中且常住者，若能生果，應是無常，有作用故，如所生果。	Among the categories are those things that are immutable and eternal, but if they can produce results, they must not be eternal. Because they do accomplish actions, they are like the results they produce.
若不生果，應非離識實有自性，如兔角等。	If they do not produce results, then they have no self nature apart from consciousness, like the horns of a rabbit.
諸無常者，若有質礙便有方分，應可分析，如軍林等，非實有性。	As for noneternal elements, if they are corporeal and substantial, they must be extended and divisible, like an army, a forest, etc., and therefore not real existents I but only nominal realities.
若無質礙，如心心所，應非離此有實自性。	If they are not corporeal, like consciousness and its activities, then they must not have any self nature apart from consciousness.
又彼所執地水火風，應非有礙，實句義攝，身根所觸故，如堅濕煖動。	Moreover, [the four elements of] earth, water, fire, and wind in their doctrine should not be included in the category of corporeal substances, because they are not contacted by bodily organs, as solidity, fluidity, heat, and motion are.
即彼所執堅濕煖等，應非無礙德句義攝，身根所觸故，如地水火風。	And the solidity, fluidity, heat, and motion that they grasp should not be included in the category of noncorporeal elements, because they are contacted by bodily organs, just as earth, water, fire, and wind are.
地水火三對青色等，俱眼所見。 准此應責，故知無實地水火風與堅濕等各別有性，亦非眼見實地水火風。	Earth, water, and fire are visible to the eye as green form, etc. This is acknowledged as being green form. Therefore there is no real earth, water, fire, and wind apart from solidity, fluidity, etc., and no one really sees such things as real earth, water, and fire. 
又彼所執實句義中有礙常者，皆有礙故，如麁地等，應是無常。	Also, in the category of substance there are things that are eternal and corporeal, but since they are corporeal, they must be like gross earth and therefore not eternal.
諸句義中色根所取無質礙法，應皆有礙，許色根取故，如地水火風。	Noncorporeal dharmas among these categories that are sensed by material organs must be corporeal, because it is admitted that they are sensed by material organs, just as earth, water, etc., are.
又彼所執非實德等，應非離識有別自性，非實攝故，如石女兒。	Also, nonsubstances such as qualities, etc., must not have distinct self-natures apart from consciousness, because they are not categorized as substances, like the son of a stone woman.
非有實等，應非離識有別自性，非有攝故，如空花等。	Since they are not real substances, they must not have distinct self-natures apart from consciousness, because, like flowers seen in the sky [by someone with an eye defect], they are not categorized as existent things.
彼所執有，應離實等無別自性，許非無故，如實德等。	The category of “existence” maintained by the Vaiśeṣikas must not possess a distinct self-nature apart from substance, etc., because it is admitted that like substance, quality, etc., it is not nonexistent. 
若離實等，應非有性，許異實等故，如畢竟無等。	If existence exists apart from substance, it must not really exist, because it is admitted that it differs from substance, like things that absolutely do not exist.
如有非無，無別有性，如何實等有別有性？	If existence is not nonexistent and has no separate nature of existence in turn, then why do substance and so on have to have separate natures of existence?
若離有法有別有性，應離無法有別無性。 彼既不然，此云何爾？	And, if there is a separate nature of existence apart from existing things, there must also be a nature of nonexistence apart from nonexisting things. If this is not so, how can the former be so?
故彼有性，唯妄計度。 又彼所執實德業性，異實德業，理定不然。	Therefore this “nature of existence” is mere false speculation. Also, it makes no sense to be attached to “nature of substance, quality, and action” that differ from actual substance, quality, and action.
勿此亦非實德業性，異實等故，如德業等。 又應實等非實等攝，異實等性故，如德業實等。	These are not the “nature of substance, quality, and action,” because they differ from substance, just as quality and action do. Also, substance is not substance because it differs from “nature of substance,” just as quality and action do. 
地等諸性對地等體更相徵詰，准此應知。	Similarly, the nature of earth, etc., in relation to earth itself, etc., can be understood by analogy with the above.
如實性等無別實等性，實等亦應無別實性等。 若離實等有實等性，應離非實等有非實等性。 彼既不爾，此云何然？ 故同異性唯假施設。	Just as the nature of substance, etc., is not distinct from substance, etc., substance, etc., must not be distinct from the nature of substance, etc. If there is a nature of substance distinct from substance, then there must also be a nature of nonsubstance distinct from nonsubstance. If the latter makes no sense, neither does the former. Therefore the issue of identical and different natures is mere supposition.	
又彼所執和合句義定非實有，非有實等諸法攝故，如畢竟無。	The category of union (samavaya) of the Vaiśeṣikas definitely does not exist, because it is not categorized as being one of the dharmas that exist, and it is like a thing that absolutely does not exist.
彼許實等現量所得，以理推徵尚非實有，況彼自許和合句義，非現量得而可實有。	They claim that substance, etc., is known through direct perception, but we have demonstrated with reason that they are not real. How much less real is this category of union that they admit is not known by direct perception.
設執和合是現量境，由前理故亦非實有。	Even if they establish that union is known by direct perception, it still does not exist, for the same reasons given previously.
然彼實等，非緣離識實有自體現量所得，許所知故，如龜毛等。	In fact, the  [nine categories such as] substance are not known through direct perception as really existing things apart from consciousness, because they are admitted as being objects that exist in the same way as the hairs of a tortoise.
又緣實智，非緣離識實句自體現量智攝，假合生故，如德智等。	Conversely, the knowledge that has substance as an object is not included in the direct perception that perceives the self-nature of substance apart from consciousness, because this knowledge arises from the convergence of fictitious dharmas, like the knowledge of qualities, etc.
廣說乃至緣和合智，非緣離識和合自體現量智攝，假合生故，如實智等。	We can say the same about all the categories, up to the category of union. It is not included in the direct perception of the self-nature of union apart from consciousness, because it too arises from the convergence of fictitious dharmas, like substance, etc.
故勝論者實等句義，亦是隨情妄所施設。	Therefore the categories of substance, etc., held by the Vaiśeṣikas, are mere speculations based on false notions.
有執有一大自在天，體實遍常能生諸法。	According to one doctrine, there is a great, self-existent deity whose substance is real and who is all-pervading, eternal, and the producer of all dharmas.
彼執非理。 所以者何？	This doctrine is unreasonable. Why?
若法能生必非常故，諸非常者必不遍故，諸不遍者非真實故。	If something produces something, it is not eternal, the noneternal is not all-pervading, and what is not all-pervading is not real.
體既常遍具諸功能，應一切處時頓生一切法。	If the deity’s substance is all-pervading and eternal, it must contain all powers and be able to produce all dharmas everywhere, at all times, and simultaneously.
待欲或緣方能生者，違一因論。	If he produces dharmas when a desire arises, or according to conditions, this contradicts the doctrine of a single cause.
或欲及緣亦應頓起，因常有故。	Or else, desires and conditions would arise spontaneously, since the cause [i.e., the deity] is eternal.
餘執有一大梵、時、方、本際、自然、虛空、我等常住實有，具諸功能生一切法，皆同此破。	Other doctrines claim that there is a great Brahma, a Time, a Space, a Starting Point, a Nature, an Ether, a Self, etc., that is eternal and really exists, is endowed with all powers, and is able to produce all dharmas.  We refute all these in the same way we did the concept of a Great Lord.
有餘偏執明論聲常，能為定量表詮諸法。	There are those who hold the opinion that the sound of the Vedas is eternal. Its power acts as an unchanging quantity that reveals all dharmas.
有執一切聲皆是常，待緣顯發方有詮表。	Another opinion holds that all sounds are eternal and are revealed in dependence on conditions.
彼俱非理。 所以者何？	Neither opinion is reasonable. Why?
且明論聲許能詮故，應非常住，如所餘聲。	Since it is granted that the sound of the Vedas can express, then it must not be eternal, like any other sound.
餘聲亦應非常聲體，如瓶衣等待眾緣故。	The other sounds [of the second view] are also not the substance of eternal sounds, because, like pots or clothing, they require a number of conditions to exist.
有外道執，地水火風極微實常，能生麁色。 所生麁色不越因量，雖是無常而體實有。	There is an opinion that the atoms of earth, water, fire, and wind are real and eternal. These give rise to gross forms. The gross forms thus produced do not exceed the quantity of the cause, and, though not eternal, their substance nevertheless really exists.
彼亦非理。 所以者何？	This opinion is also unreasonable. Why?
所執極微若有方分，如蟻行等，體應非實。 若無方分，如心心所，應不共聚生麁果色。	If the atoms they cling to have parts, like a column of ants, then the substance is not eternal. If they do not have parts, like mind and mental activities, then they are unable to produce gross matter through aggregation.
既能生果，如彼所生，如何可說極微常住？ 又所生果不越因量，應如極微不名麁色，則此果色應非眼等色根所取，便違自執。	Also, since they produce a result, being like what they produce, how can it be granted that atoms are eternal? Also, the result that is created does not exceed the quantity of the cause. Thus it must be like atoms and not called “gross form,” and consequently the created form must not be graspable by material organs such as eyes, etc. This contradicts their own tenet.
若謂果色量德合故，非麁似麁，色根所能取。 所執果色既同因量，應如極微無麁德合。 或應極微亦麁德合，如麁果色，處無別故。	If they claim that the resulting form combines with quantity and thus resembles gross form, though it is actually not, and in this way can be perceived, then this resulting form that they cling to must be coextensive with the cause and, like atoms, uncombined with the quality of quantity. Or else, the atoms must be united with the quantity of grossness, like gross forms, because there must be no distinction of location.
若謂果色遍在自因，因非一故可名麁者，則此果色體應非一，如所在因，處各別故。	If it is claimed that the result pervades its own cause and, because the cause is not single, the result may be called “gross,” then the substance of this result also must not be single, just as the causes in which it resides are not single, because the location of each must be different.
既爾此果還不成麁，由此亦非色根所取。 若果多分合故成麁，多因極微合應非細，足成根境，何用果為？	In this case, the result would not even be gross. Consequently, it would not be sensed by a physical organ. If the result combines many parts and forms a gross effect, then the many causal atoms must not be subtle and fine, sufficient to form the object of a sense organ, so of what use would such a result be?
既多分成，應非實有，則汝所執前後相違。 又果與因俱有質礙，應不同處，如二極微。 若謂果因體相受入，如沙受水、藥入鎔銅。 誰許沙銅體受水藥？	Since the result is formed of multiple parts, it must not be eternal, and therefore your former and latter opinions are self-contradictory. Moreover, both causes and results are impenetrable as masses and cannot occupy the same place, just as two atoms cannot. If it is claimed that the substances of both the cause and the result accept each other and interpenetrate, like sand accepting water and drugs penetrating molten copper, who says that sand and molten copper accept water and drugs?
或應離變，非一非常。 又麁色果體若是一，得一分時應得一切，彼此一故，彼應如此。	[If this were to occur,] the atoms would separate and alter, and thus they would be neither eternal nor unitary. Also, if the substance of the resulting gross form is unitary, then when you perceive one part, you must perceive all parts, because all parts would be the same.
不許違理、許便違事，故彼所執進退不成，但是隨情虛妄計度。	If you do not agree, then your reasoning is faulty; if you do agree, then you contradict fact. Hence this opinion ends in dilemma and goes nowhere. It is mere vain speculation arising from delusion.
然諸外道品類雖多，所執有法不過四種：	However, though there are many theories of actual dharmas among non-Buddhists, they all come down to four types.
一、執有法與有等性其體定一，如數論等。 彼執非理。 所以者何？	The first, that of the Samkhyas and others, holds that actual dharmas and the nature of existence, etc., are identical. This theory is unreasonable. Why?
勿一切法即有性故。 皆如有性，體無差別，便違三德我等體異，亦違世間諸法差別。	Because it must not be that all dharmas are the same as existence, for all would be like existence, without any distinction of substance. This contradicts the theory that the three qualities (sattva, etc.), self (atman), etc., are all different in substance. It also contradicts the empirical distinction among dharmas.
又若色等即色等性，色等應無青黃等異。	Also, if colors, etc., are identical with the nature of color, then there must be no distinction such as green, yellow, etc.
二、執有法與有等性其體定異，如勝論等。	The second theory, that of the Vaiśeṣikas, is that actual dharmas and the nature of existence, etc., are definitely different in substance.
彼執非理。 所以者何？	This is unreasonable. Why?
勿一切法非有性故。	Because it must not be that all dharmas are not identical with existence.
如已滅無，體不可得，便違實等自體非無，亦違世間現見有物。	Like something ruined and nonexistent, their substance would be undetectable. This contradicts the Vaiśeṣika theory that the substance of actual things is not nonexistent. Moreover, it contradicts the empirical fact that objects exist.
又若色等非色等性，應如聲等非眼等境。	Also, if colors, etc., are not identical with the nature of colors, etc., then, like sounds, etc., they would not be objects of sight, etc.
三、執有法與有等性亦一亦異，如無慚等。	According to the third theory, that of the Jains, actual dharmas and the nature of existence are both identical and different.
彼執非理。 所以者何？	This is unreasonable. Why?
一異同前一異過故，二相相違體應別故，一異體同俱不成故。	Because the error of both identity and difference is the same as previous errors of each side respectively. Also, the two characteristics are mutually contradictory, because they differ in substance; and neither identity nor difference could be established if their substance were identical.
勿一切法皆同一體，或應一異是假非實，而執為實，理定不成。	It must not be that all dharmas are of the same identical substance. On the other hand, it may well be that such distinctions as identity and difference are fictions rather than realities, although they are grasped as real. This principle is definitely not established.
四，執有法與有等性非一非異，如邪命等。	The fourth theory, that of the Ajivikas, etc., holds that existing dharmas are neither the same as, nor different from, the nature of existence, etc.
彼執非理。 所以者何？	This doctrine is unreasonable. Why?
非一異執同異一故。	Because the doctrine of neither identity nor difference is similar to the foregoing doctrine of both identity and difference.
非一異言，為遮為表？	Does the statement neither identical nor different deny or affirm?
若唯是表，應不雙非。	If it just affirms, then it ought not to negate both possibilities.
若但是遮，應無所執。 亦遮亦表，應互相違。 非表非遮，應成戲論。	If it just denies, then it has nothing to say. Also, if it both affirms and denies, then the two sides cancel each other, and if it neither affirms nor denies, this is frivolous talk.
又非一異，違世共知有一異物，亦違自宗色等有法決定實有。	This doctrine of neither identity nor difference also contradicts ordinary understanding that there are things that are identical or different, and it contradicts the Ajivikas own tenet that real dharmas such as forms really do exist.
是故彼言唯矯避過，諸有智者勿謬許之。	Therefore this doctrine is merely a device to avoid problems, and the wise do not accept it.
餘乘所執離識實有色等諸法，如何非有？	Other schools of Buddhism maintain that there are such really existing dharmas as form that are external to consciousness. Why do we deny this?
彼所執色、不相應行及諸無為，理非有故。	Because form, dharmas unassociated with mind, and unconditioned dharmas grasped by these schools do not really exist.
且所執色總有二種：	The form grasped by these schools falls into two groups:
一者有對，極微所成；二者無對，非極微成。	Those that are resistant and composed of atoms, and those that are not resistant and are not composed of atoms.
彼有對色定非實有，能成極微非實有故。	Resistant forms definitely do not really exist, because the atoms of which they are composed do not really exist.
謂諸極微若有質礙，應如瓶等，是假非實。	If atoms are mutually resistant, then they are fictions, not realities, like pots, etc.
若無質礙，應如非色，如何可集成瓶衣等？	If they are not mutually resistant, they are like nonforms, and hence they could not gather together to form pots, clothing, etc.
又諸極微若有方分，必可分析，便非實有。	Also, if atoms have extension, they must be divisible and not real.
若無方分，則如非色，云何和合承光發影？	If they are unextended, then, since they are like nonforms, how can they combine and receive light or cast shadows?
日輪纔舉照柱等時，東西兩邊光影各現，承光發影處既不同，所執極微定有方分。	When the sun rises and illuminates something like a pillar, the east side and the west side are illuminated and shaded respectively. Since the side that receives light and the side that is shaded are not identical, the atoms are established as being extended.
又若見觸壁等物時，唯得此邊不得彼分，既和合物即諸極微，故此極微必有方分。	Also, when you see or touch something such as a wall, you can only see one side and not the other. Since the wall and the atoms are identical, the atoms must be extended.
又諸極微隨所住處必有上下四方差別，不爾便無共和集義，或相涉入，應不成麁，由此極微定有方分。	Also, wherever there are atoms, they must have such differences as being above or below, or in one of the four directions. If this is not so, it cannot be said that they gather together and combine. Otherwise, if they interpenetrate, they do not I form as a larger mass and I become gross form. Therefore atoms definitely have extension.
執有對色即諸極微，若無方分，應無障隔，若爾便非障礙有對。	If it is claimed that resistant form is identical with atoms, then if atoms are not extended, form will not obstruct or separate things. In this case, it is neither obstructive nor resistant.
是故汝等所執極微必有方分，有方分故便可分析，定非實有，故有對色實有不成。	Therefore the atoms clung to by these schools must have extension, and since they are extended they are divisible and therefore not real. Therefore the reality of resistant form is inadmissible.
五識豈無所依緣色？ 雖非無色而是識變。 謂識生時，內因緣力變似眼等色等相現，即以此相為所依緣。 然眼等根非現量得，以能發識比知是有，此但功能非外所造。	How can the five kinds of consciousness not have supports or form as objects? It is just that they are not lacking in form as a support but that this form is a transformation of consciousness. That is, when consciousness arises, through the power of internal causes, it transforms and on the basis of these images there is a support and an object for the senses. However, the visual faculty, etc., are not known by direct perception. They are inferred by their ability to produce consciousness. They are only powers, not something produced externally.
外有對色理既不成，故應但是內識變現。	An external resistant form is inadmissible, and therefore it must be the mere transformation and appearance of internal consciousness.
發眼等識名眼等根，此為所依生眼等識，此眼等識外所緣緣理非有故，決定應許自識所變為所緣緣，謂能引生似自識者，汝執彼是此所緣緣。	When it appears as visual consciousness, for example, it is called the visual faculty, because it is the support that generates visual consciousness. An external condition as object, external to visual consciousness, is inadmissible, and therefore it must be granted that the condition as object is the transformation of ones consciousness. It is said by the Small Vehicle that that which generates consciousness similar to itself is a condition in the form of an object.
非但能生，勿因緣等亦名此識所緣緣故。	That that alone cannot generate consciousness, because it must not be that conditions as cause, etc., are to be called condition in the form of object.
眼等五識了色等時，但緣和合似彼相故。	When the five forms of consciousness, such as visual consciousness, etc., perceive a color, etc., they have as their object nothing but aggregates, because they are similar to the image.
非和合相異諸極微有實自體，分析彼時似彼相識定不生故。	But the image of the aggregation, being different from the atoms themselves, has no real substance, because when the aggregation is divided, a consciousness similar to the image definitely does not arise.
彼和合相既非實有，故不可說是五識緣，勿第二月等能生五識故。	Since the image of this aggregation is not real, it cannot be claimed that it is the condition for the five kinds of consciousness, because something, like a second moon, cannot generate the five kinds of consciousness.
非諸極微共和合位可與五識各作所緣，此識上無極微相故。	Nor do all the atoms combine and thus become the condition as object for the arising of each of the five kinds of consciousness, because in that case there is no image of atoms in consciousness.
非諸極微有和合相，不和合時無此相故。	Atoms do not have the characteristic of the aggregation, because when they are uncombined, that characteristic does not exist.
非和合位與不合時，此諸極微體相有異，故和合位如不合時，色等極微非五識境。	Nor, either combined or uncombined, do the substance and characteristics of atoms have any difference, and therefore just as in an uncombined state, the atoms of form, etc., when combined, are not the object of the five consciousnesses.
有執色等一一極微，不和集時非五識境，共和集位展轉相資，有麁相生為此識境，彼相實有，為此所緣。	There is a theory that individual atoms of form, etc., are not the object of consciousness in an uncombined state, but when combined they evolve and assist each other to produce gross form, and this is the object of consciousness. That form is real and is the object of consciousness.
彼執不然，共和集位與未集時體相一故。 瓶甌等物、極微等者，緣彼相識應無別故。	But this is not so, because whether combined or uncombined, atoms retain the same substance and characteristics, and so, since the atoms of, say, a pot or a bowl are the same, there would be no difference when consciousness has them as objects.
共和集位一一極微，各各應捨微圓相故。	Also, in a state of combination, each atom loses its characteristics of minuteness and roundness.
非麁相識緣細相境，勿餘境識緣餘境故，一識應緣一切境故。	Nor can consciousness of gross form take as an object smaller forms, because it must not be that a certain consciousness can have as an object the object of another consciousness, and because in that case one kind of consciousness must take as its object that of another consciousness.
許有極微尚致此失，況無識外真實極微。	Even admitting the existence of atoms, these errors persist. How much less are there any atoms external to consciousness.
由此定知，自識所變似色等相為所緣緣，見託彼生帶彼相故。	Consequently, we definitely know that images resembling form, etc., which are transformations of consciousness, are the condition as object for consciousness, because the seeing part of consciousness is generated thanks to that image and incorporates it as its own object.
然識變時隨量大小頓現一相，非別變作眾多極微合成一物。	When consciousness evolves, it suddenly produces a single image that may be large or small, but it does not evolve in parts to form a multiplicity of atoms that then combine into an object.
為執麁色有實體者，佛說極微今其除析，非謂諸色實有極微。	Now, a doctrine of Buddhism states that gross form is not a real object. The reason the Buddha spoke of atoms was so that people would reject the notion. He did not mean that form is composed of real atoms.
諸瑜伽師以假想慧，於麁色相漸次除析，至不可析假說極微。	The Yoga masters, relying on conventional thought and wisdom, divide forms of gross matter progressively to the point where it is no longer divisible and conventionally designate what remains as atoms. These atoms are said to be extended but no longer divisible.
雖此極微猶有方分而不可析，若更析之便似空現不名為色，故說極微是色邊際。	If they were again divided, atoms would resemble space and could no longer be called form. They therefore say that atoms are the limit of form.
由此應知，諸有對色皆識變現，非極微成。	As a result of this, you should realize that resistant forms appear from the transformation of consciousness and are not composed of atoms.
餘無對色是此類故，亦非實有。	Form that is not resistant is like resistant form and is not real.
或無對故，如心心所，定非實色。	Or being like mind and its activities, it is not real form.
諸有對色現有色相，以理推究離識尚無，況無對色現無色相而可說為真實色法？	We must conclude on the basis of reason that resistant form that manifests the characteristics of real form does not exist apart from consciousness. How much less can nonresistant form, not having the characteristics of form, be said to be real form!
表無表色，豈非實有？	Do not indicative form and nonindicative form really exist?
此非實有。 所以者何？	No, they do not really exist. Why?
且身表色若是實有，以何為性？	If we grant that bodily indicative form really exists, what is its nature?
若言是形，便非實有，可分析故，長等極微不可得故。	If you say that it is form, then it does not exist, because, as form, it is divisible, and atoms of length, etc., are not perceptible.
若言是動，亦非實有，纔生即滅，無動義故。 有為法滅不待因故，滅若待因應非滅故。	If you say that its nature is movement, it again does not exist, because it perishes as soon as it arises and thus does not actually move, and because conditioned dharmas perish without need of a cause, because if perishing required a cause, it would not be perishing.
若言有色非顯非形，心所引生能動手等名身表業。	If it is claimed that there is form that is neither evident nor corporeal and is generated by mental activity to move hands, etc., and that this is what is meant by indicative bodily form, this is not reasonable.
理亦不然，此若是動，義如前破。	If it is movement, we have already rejected that previously.
若是動因，應即風界，風無表示不應名表。	If it is the cause of movement, then it would resemble the element of wind, but wind does not indicate, so it cannot be said to indicate.
又觸不應通善惡性，非顯香味，類觸應知，故身表業定非實有。 然心為因，令識所變手等色相生滅相續轉趣餘方，似有動作表示心故，假名身表。	What is more, physical contact is neither good nor bad by nature and is therefore metaphorically designated as bodily indication.
語表亦非實有聲性，一剎那聲無詮表故，多念相續便非實故，外有對色前已破故。	Vocal indication does not have the nature of real sound, because sound during an instant does not indicate anything. Also, sound in a continuous series of instants is not real. Also, the reality of external resistant form has already been refuted.
然因心故，識變似聲生滅相續似有表示，假名語表，於理無違。	However, with mind as cause, something resembling sound evolves from consciousness, appears and disappears in a continuous series, and seems to indicate or inform, and for this reason it is metaphorically designated as vocal indication without violating reason.
表既實無，無表寧實？	Now, if indication is not real, how can nonindication be real?
然依思願善惡分限，假立無表，理亦無違。	However, vows or intentions of good and bad for a certain time could be metaphorically established as being nonindication, with no violation of reason.
謂此或依發勝身語善惡思種增長位立，或依定中止身語惡現行思立，故是假有。	This means that it metaphorically exists in a situation in which seeds of good or bad volitions increase and grow on the basis of the expression of outstanding physical or vocal acts, or in a situation in which the intention is actually active and stops physical or vocal acts during samādhi.
世尊經中說有三業，撥身語業豈不違經？	In the scriptures, the Buddha mentions three kinds of action. Do you not deny this in denying physical and vocal action?
不撥為無，但言非色。	we do not deny them; we merely deny that they are form.
能動身思說名身業，能發語思說名語業，審決二思意相應故、作動意故，說名意業。	We say that bodily action is an intention that moves the body, and vocal action is an intention that produces words. Because the two intentions of reflection and judgement are connected with mind and agitate it, they are called mental acts.
起身語思有所造作，說名為業。	The effect of physical and vocal intention is called action.
是審決思所遊履故，通生苦樂異熟果故，亦名為道，故前七業道，亦思為自性。	We speak of action as a path because it is traversed by the intentions of reflection and judgement, and because it is a path that leads to the production of the fruit of retribution of pain and pleasure. Therefore intention is the essence of the first seven paths of karma.
或身語表中思發故，假說為業。 思所履故，說名業道。	Alternately, we may also speak of physical and vocal indications resulting from intention as action, and because they travel the path of intention we refer to them as paths of action.
由此應知，實無外色，唯有內識變似色生。 不相應行亦非實有。 所以者何？	Consequently, you must realize that there is no real external form but only internal consciousness that evolves resembling form. Also, forces not associated with mind do not really exist. Why?
得非得等，非如色心及諸心所體相可得，非異色心及諸心所作用可得，由此故知定非實有，但依色等分位假立。	Because such dharmas as acquisition and nonacquisition do not have substances or characteristics that can be perceived in the way that form, mind, and mental activities can; and besides, no function of their own distinct from form, mind, and mental activities can be found. Consequently, you must realize that they definitely do not exist. They are established metaphorically on the basis of states of form, mind, etc.
此定非異色心心所有實體用，如色心等，許蘊攝故。	They definitely do not have real substances or functions apart from form, mind, and mental activities, because they are admitted as belonging to the category of aggregates, such as form, mind etc.
或心心所及色，無為所不攝故，如畢竟無，定非實有。 或餘實法所不攝故，如餘假法非實有體。 	Or, they do not really exist, like things that are absolutely nonexistent, because they are not categorized as mind, mental activities, form, or unconditioned [dharmas]. Or, they do not exist, because like other fictitious entities they are not included among other real dharmas. 
且彼如何知得非得異色心等有實體用？ 契經說故。 如說如是補特伽羅成就善惡，聖者成就十無學法。	How do [the Sarvastivadins, etc.,] know that acquisition and nonacquisition have real substances and functions apart from form, mind, etc.? Because a scripture says, “Such a person acquires good and bad, but the worthy one [the arhat] acquires the ten dharmas of the post learner stage.
又說異生不成就聖法，諸阿羅漢不成就煩惱。	It also says, Ordinary people do not acquire noble dharmas, and a worthy one does not acquire afflictions.
成不成言，顯得非得。	It is said that this language of acquires and does not acquire refers to acquisition and nonacquisition.
經不說此異色心等有實體用，為證不成。	The scripture in question does not say that acquisition and nonacquisition have real substances and functions apart from form, mind, etc., so the proof is inconclusive.
亦說輪王成就七寶，豈即成就他身非情？	The scriptures say that a world conquering monarch acquires the seven treasures, but how can one acquire the body of another or inanimate objects?
若謂於寶有自在力，假說成就；於善惡法何不許然？	If it means that the king exercises power over the treasures and in that sense acquires them, then is this not also so of such things as good and bad?
而執實得 若謂七寶在現在故可假說成，寧知所成善惡等法離現在有？	Also, if in clinging to a real acquisition, it is said that the treasures can be said to be acquired because they are actually present, then how would you know that the good and bad dharmas that you can obtain exist apart from the present moment?
離現實法理非有故，現在必有善種等故。	In reality, real dharmas do not exist apart from the present, and these present dharmas contain the seeds of good.
又得於法有何勝用？	Also, what are the specific functions of acquisition as far as dharmas are concerned?
若言能起，應起無為，一切非情應永不起，未得已失應永不生。	If it is claimed that produces dharmas, it ought to be able to produce unconditioned dharmas, and, also, inanimate things would never be produced. Also, what has never been acquired or has been lost would remain forever unproduced.
若俱生得為因起者，所執二生便為無用。	If the cause for birth I of dharmas I is an acquisition born with them, then the two births would have no function.
又具善惡無記得者，善惡無記應頓現前，若待餘因得便無用。	In the case of someone possessing good, bad, or indeterminate dharmas, these would be present instantly, and if they require conditions to be present, then acquisition serves no purpose.
若得於法是不失因，有情由此成就彼故。諸可成法不離有情。	If it is claimed that acquisition is the cause for the nonloss of dharmas, because sentient beings attain these dharmas through acquisition, we answer that dharmas that can be acquired are never separate from beings.
若離有情實不可得，故得於法俱為無用。 得實無故，非得亦無，然依有情可成諸法，分位假立三種成就：一種子成就、二自在成就、三現行成就。翻此假立不成就名。	If these were separate, they could never be acquired. Consequently, acquisition serves no purpose with regard to dharmas because it does not exist, and neither does nonacquisition. However, in relation to states of dharmas that sentient beings may attain, we may conventionally establish three kinds of acquisition: first that attained as a result of seed impressions; second that attained through sovereignty; and third that attained through actuality. In contradistinction to acquisition, there is something we can provisionally designate as nonacquisition.
此類雖多，而於三界見所斷種未永害位，假立非得，	There are numerous types. The name is given provisionally to that state in which the seeds that are to be destroyed in the path of insight are not definitively destroyed.
名異生性，於諸聖法未成就故。	We call this the stage of ordinary beings because the dharma of sainthood has not yet been acquired.
復如何知異色心等有實同分？ 	Again, we ask, how do you know that there is a real thing called similarity apart from form, mind, etc.?
契經說故。如契經說，此天同分、此人同分，乃至廣說。	Because a scripture speaks of similarity of celestials, similarity of humans, etc.
此經不說異色心等有實同分，為證不成。	But, we reply, the scripture does not say that there is real similarity apart from form, mind, etc., and so your proof is inconclusive.
若同智言因斯起故知實有者，則草木等應有同分。	If it is claimed that it exists because it is the cause for similar knowledge or similar speech, then grass and trees should have it.
又於同分起同智言，同分復應有別同分。	Also, if the same knowledge or speech arises as a result of similarity, then similarity ought to have a separate similarity.
彼既不爾，此云何然？	However, since this is not so, how can you claim that it is real?
若謂為因起同事欲知實有者，理亦不然，宿習為因起同事欲，何要別執有實同分？	If it is claimed that it is the cause for similar affairs and desires, this is unreasonable. Similar affairs and desires have as a cause the habits of former lives. What is the need for some separate dharma that you call similarity ?
然依有情身心相似分位差別，假立同分。	The fact is that by the term similarity we metaphorically designate those physical and mental characteristics that are common to living beings of different kinds.
復如何知異色心等有實命根？	Also, how do you know that there is a real vital principle  apart from form, mind, etc.?
契經說故。 如契經說，壽、煖、識三，應知命根說名為壽。	Because a scripture speaks of life, heat, and consciousness, and you should know that the vital principle is what is referred to here as life.
此經不說異色心等有實壽體，為證不成。 又先已成色不異識，應比離識無別命根。 又若命根異識實有，應如受等非實命根。	But, [we reply,] the scripture does not say that there is a real life substance apart from form, mind, etc., so your proof is inconclusive. Also, we have already demonstrated that there is no real form apart from consciousness, so you must assume by analogy that there is no separate vital principle apart from consciousness. Moreover, if a real vital principal exists apart from consciousness, then it must be like feeling, etc., and not a real vital principle. 
若爾如何經說三法？ 義別說三，如四正斷。 	Why then does the scripture speak of “life, heat, and consciousness”? It speaks of these three in order to distinguish the meaning of consciousness, just as it speaks, for instance, of the “four perfect relinquishments.” 
住無心位，壽、煖應無。	When one is in the trance state of unconsciousness, must one not be without life and heat? 
豈不經說識不離身？	But, does the scripture not say that consciousness does not leave the body?
既爾如何名無心位？ 彼滅轉識，非阿賴耶有此識因，後當廣說。	Then why does the scripture speak of an unconscious state? Later, we shall discuss the reasons for the existence of this consciousness. This consciousness is sufficient to act as the substratum for the three realms, the six paths of existence, and the I four forms of l birth.
此識足為界趣生體，是遍恒續異熟果故，無勞別執有實命根。	Because it is universal, is constantly continuing in a series, and is the fruit of the maturation of causes, there is no need to cling to a separate vital principle.
然依親生此識種子，由業所引功能差別住時決定，假立命根。	The truth is that the term vital principle refers to powers or abilities of various kinds that result from action and that are supported by seeds that engender the eighth consciousness; and these powers enable form, mind, etc., to endure for a time.
復如何知二無心定、無想異熟異色心等有實自性？	Again, how do you know that the two attainments of unconsciousness and the fruits of the meditative state of no thought have real natures apart from form, mind, and other dharmas?
若無實性，應不能遮心心所法令不現起。	If they do not have real natures, then they would be unable to suppress mind and its activities and prevent their occurrence.
若無心位有別實法異色心等能遮於心名無心定，應無色時有別實法異色心等能礙於色名無色定。	If in the state of no mind there are separate, real dharmas different from form, mind, etc., that can suppress the mind, then when one is formless, there must be separate, real dharmas apart from form, mind, etc., named formless attainments that can obstruct form.
彼既不爾，此云何然？	Since this is not so, how can your statement be true?
又遮礙心何須實法？	Also, why are real dharmas necessary to suppress the mind?
如堤塘等假亦能遮。	Objects of merely nominal existence, like dams and dikes, can impede.
謂修定時，於定加行厭患麁動心心所故，發勝期願遮心心所，令心心所漸細漸微。	In cultivating meditation at the stage of equipment, one becomes disgusted with gross, active states of mind and mental activities, and, as a result of putting forth a supreme resolution, one makes mind and its activities become gradually finer and more subtle.
微微心時熏異熟識成極增上厭心等種，由此損伏心等種故，麁動心等暫不現行，依此分位假立二定，此種善故定亦名善。	When the mind is extremely fine, it perfumes the consciousness as retribution and creates extremely potent seeds of thought of disgust, etc. Because of these seeds of thought of disgust, etc., gross and active states of mind are for a time no longer present. The two samādhis result from dividing this state. Since the seeds are good, the samādhis are also said to be good.
無想定前求無想果，故所熏成種，招彼異熟識。	Prior to the attainment of no thought, one seeks the result, no thought, and therefore the seeds created by perfuming provoke consciousness as retribution.
依之麁動想等不行，於此分位假立無想。	This state is such that gross and active thoughts become inactive, and this state is conventionally called no thought.
依異熟立，得異熟名。	It gets the name retribution because it is founded on retribution.
故此三法亦非實有。	Therefore these three dharmas do not really exist.
