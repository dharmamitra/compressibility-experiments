如是我聞：	This is what I heard:
一時，佛在毘耶離菴羅樹園，與大比丘眾八千人俱，	At one time the Buddha was in the Amra Gardens in the city of Vaishali, accompanied by a multitude of leading monks num bering eight thousand.
菩薩三萬二千——眾所知識，大智本行，皆悉成就；	There were also thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas, all known to the assembly, persons who had carried out all the basic practices of great wisdom.
諸佛威神之所建立，為護法城，受持正法；	Sustained by the might and supernatural powers of the Buddhas, they accepted and upheld the correct Law in order to guard the citadel of the Dharma.
能師子吼，名聞十方；	They knew how to roar the lion's roar, and their fame resounded irt the ten directions.
眾人不請，友而安之；	Without waiting to be asked, they befriended others and brought them comfort.
紹隆三寶，能使不絕；	They ensured the continuance and prosperity of the Three Treasures, making certain that these never expired.
降伏魔怨，制諸外道，	They conquered and subdued the ill will of the devils and curbed the non-Buddhist doctrines.
悉已清淨，永離蓋纏；心常安住，無礙解脫；	All were spotless and pure, having long ago rid themselves of snares and obstructions; their minds constantly resided in a state of unhindered emancipation.
念、定、總持、辯才不斷；布施、持戒、忍辱、精進、禪定、智慧及方便、力，無不具足；	Their mindfulness, meditation, retention of the teachings, and eloquence never faltered, and of almsgiving, keeping of the precepts, forbearance, assiduousness, meditation, wisdom, and the power to employ expedient means, there was not one they were deficient in.
逮無所得不起法忍；	They had learned to accept the fact that there is nothing to be grasped at, no view of phenomena to be entertained.
已能隨順，轉不退輪；	They knew how to respond compliantly to others and to turn the unregressing wheel of the Law.
善解法相，知眾生根；蓋諸大眾得無所畏、	Expert in comprehending the characteristics of phenomena, able to understand the capacities of living beings, they towered over the others of the great assembly and had learned to be fearful of nothing.
功德智慧，以修其心；相好嚴身，色像第一，捨諸世間所有飾好；	With their merits and wisdom they disciplined their minds; they adorned their bodies with auspicious signs, ranking foremost in aspect and form, but rejected all worldly embellishments.
名稱高遠，踰於須彌；深信堅固，猶若金剛；	In fame and renown they soared higher than Mount Sumeru; their profound faith was diamondlike in its firmness.
法寶普照，而雨甘露；於眾言音，微妙第一；	The jewels of their Dharma shone everywhere, raining down sweet dew, and among the assembly the sound of their words was the most subtle and wonderful of all.
深入緣起，斷諸邪見，有無二邊，無復餘習；	They had plumbed the depths of dependent origination and cut off all erroneous views, no longer entertaining the concepts either of being or nonbeing.
演法無畏，猶師子吼，其所講說，乃如雷震，	In expounding the Law they were fearless as roaring lions, and their disquisitions on it rolled forth like thunder.
無有量，已過量；	There was no measuring them, for they had passed beyond measure.
集眾法寶，如海導師，	In seeking out the jewels of the Dharma, they were like practiced pilots at sea.
了達諸法深妙之義；善知眾生往來所趣及心所行；	They had mastered all the profound and subtle meanings of the doctrines and were expert in perceiving the past and future existences of living beings and the workings of their minds.
近無等等佛自在慧、十力、無畏、十八不共；	They came close to equaling the freely exercised wisdom of the Buddha, the unparalleled one, his ten powers, his fearlessness, and his eighteen unshared properties.
關閉一切諸惡趣門，而生五道以現其身；為大醫王，善療眾病，應病與藥，令得服行；	Though they had firmly closed the gate to all manner of evil existences, yet they allowed themselves to be born in the five lower realms, manifesting themselves there so that they might act as great physician kings, adroitly healing the ills of others, doling out whatever medicine suited the ailment, and insuring that the patient took it as prescribed.
無量功德皆成就，無量佛土皆嚴淨；	Countless benefits— all these they had acquired; countless Buddha lands — all these they had made marvelously pure.
其見聞者，無不蒙益，諸有所作，亦不唐捐：	No one saw or listened to them without profiting thereby, and no action of theirs was ever performed in vain.
如是一切功德，皆悉具足——	Such was the manner in which all merits adhered to them.

如是等三萬二千人。	There were thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas such as these.
復有萬梵天王尸棄等，從餘四天下來詣佛所而聽法；	There were also ten thousand Brahma kings, Shikhin and others, who had come from the other four-continent worlds to visit the place where the Buddha was and listen to the Dharma.
復有萬二千天帝，亦從餘四天下來在會坐；	There were also twelve thousand Indras who had come from the other four-continent worlds to take a seat in the gathering.
并餘大威力諸天、龍神、夜叉、乾闥婆、阿脩羅、迦樓羅、緊那羅、摩睺羅伽等，悉來會坐；	In addition, there were other heavenly beings of great authority and power, as well as dragons, spirits, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kimnaras, mahoragas, and others, all come to take a seat in the assembly.
諸比丘、比丘尼、優婆塞、優婆夷，俱來會坐。	Also arrived to take seats in the assembly were the various monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.
彼時佛與無量百千之眾，恭敬圍繞而為說法，	At that time the Buddha, reverently surrounded by this multitude of countless hundreds and thousands of beings, expounded the Law for them.
譬如須彌山王顯于大海，	He was like Mount Sumeru, king of mountains, rising up out of the great sea.
安處眾寶師子之座，蔽於一切諸來大眾。	Resting at ease in his lion's seat clustered with jewels, he shed his radiance over all the great throng gathered there.
爾時毘耶離城有長者子，名曰寶積，與五百長者子，俱持七寶蓋來詣佛所，	At that time a man named Jeweled Accumulation, son of a wealthy man of the city of Vaishali, along with five hundred other sons of wealthy men, had come to the place where the Buddha was, all of them bearing parasols adorned with the seven treasures.
頭面禮足，各以其蓋共供養佛。	Bowing their heads in obeisance before the feet of the Buddha, they joined in offering their parasols as alms to the Buddha.
佛之威神，令諸寶蓋合成一蓋，遍覆三千大千世界，	The Buddha with his supernatural powers then caused all the jeweled parasols to come together and form one single parasol that spread over the entire thousand-millionfold world.
而此世界廣長之相悉於中現；	All the vast features of that world were visible there in its midst.
又此三千大千世界諸須彌山、雪山、目真隣陀山、摩訶目真隣陀山、香山、寶山、金山、黑山、鐵圍山、大鐵圍山，大海江河，川流泉源及日月星辰、天宮、龍宮、諸尊神宮，悉現於寶蓋中；	All the Mount Sumerus of the thousand-millionfold world, Snow Mountains, Muchilinda Mountains, Mahamuchilinda Mountains, Fragrant Mountains, Jeweled Mountains, Gold Mountains, Black Mountains, Iron Encircling Mountains, Great Iron Encircling Mountains, the huge seas, the rivers and watercourses, brooks and streams, fountains and springs, as well as the suns, moons, stars, constellations, heavenly palaces, dragon palaces, and the palaces of the venerable spirits— all these were to be seen within the jeweled parasol.
又十方諸佛、諸佛說法，亦現於寶蓋中。	And the Buddhas of the ten directions, the Buddhas as they preached the Law— these too were visible within the jeweled parasol.
爾時一切大眾，覩佛神力，歎未曾有！	At that time all the members of the great assembly, witnessing this manifestation of the Buddha's supernatural powers, sighed in admiration at what they had never seen before.
合掌禮佛，瞻仰尊顏，目不暫捨。	Pressing their palms together, they made obeisance to the Buddha, gazing up in reverence at the face of the Honored One and never taking their eyes from it.
於是長者子寶積即於佛前，以偈頌曰：	Then the rich man's son, Jeweled Accumulation, in the presence of the Buddha recited these verses of praise: 
「目淨脩廣如青蓮，­心淨已度諸禪定，久積淨業稱無量，導眾以寂故稽首。	Eyes pure and broad like the blue lotus; mind pure, steeped in meditations; for pure deeds long accumulated, boundless in fame,your quietude guides the assembly— thus we bow our heads.
既見大聖以神變，普現十方無量土，其中諸佛演說法，於是一切悉見聞。	We have seen the great sage work miraculous transformations, showing us all the countless lands in ten directions,the Buddhas expounding the Law therein— every one of these we have seen and heard.
法王法力超群生，常以法財施一切，	The Dharma King's Dharma powers surpass all other beings, constantly he bestows Dharma riches on them all.
能善分別諸法相，於第一義而不動，	Skillfully he distinguishes the characteristics of phenomena, never faltering in his grasp of the one great Truth.
已於諸法得自在，是故稽首此法王。	You have learned to treat all phenomena with freedom,so we bow our heads to this Dharma King.
說法不有亦不無，以因緣故諸法生，	You define things as neither existing nor not existing; causes and conditions bring about their birth.
無我無造無受者，善惡之業亦不亡。	No I, no doer, no recipient, yet good and bad karma never cease to function.
始在佛樹力降魔，得甘露滅覺道成，	Beneath the Buddha tree, you used your might to overpower the devil; gaining the sweet dew of nirvana, you won your way to enlightenment.
已無心意無受行，而悉摧伏諸外道。	Already free of thought, perception, and volition,you refuted all the non-Buddhist doctrines.
三轉法輪於大千，其輪本來常清淨，	Three times you turned the wheel of the Law in the thousand-millionfold world, the wheel that from the first has always been pure.
天人得道此為證，三寶於是現世間。	Heavenly and human beings gained the way— this was proof of it; the Three Treasures thereupon appeared in the world.
以斯妙法濟群生，一受不退常寂然，	This wonderful Law brought rescue to the many beings; embracing it, they never regress but dwell in constant quietude.
度老病死大醫王，當禮法海德無邊。	Great physician king, healer of old age, sickness and death, we pay homage to the boundless virtue of your Dharma sea; 
毀譽不動如須彌，於善不善等以慈，	unmoved by acclamation or abuse, like Mount Sumeru, you pity in equal measure the good and the not good.
心行平等如虛空，孰聞人寶不敬承？	In mind and action impartial, like the empty sky—who can hark to this jewel of humankind, not give respectful assent?
今奉世尊此微蓋，於中現我三千界，	Now we offer these little parasols to the World-Honored One, and in them is revealed to us the three thousand worlds.
諸天龍神所居宮，乾闥婆等及夜叉。悉見世間諸所有，十力哀現是化變，	Palaces where gods, dragons, and spirits reside,kimnaras, yakshas, and all those other beings, everything that exists in the world we see— the ten-powered one in pity manifests these transformations.
眾覩希有皆歎佛，今我稽首三界尊。	The assembly, seeing this rare sight, all praise the Buddha; now we bow our heads to the venerable one of the threefold world.
大聖法王眾所歸，淨心觀佛靡不欣，	Great sage, Dharma King, refuge of the multitude—viewing the Buddha with purified mind, none who do not rejoice!
各見世尊在其前，斯則神力不共法；	Each sees the World-Honored One standing right before him— such are the Buddha's transcendental powers, his unshared properties.
佛以一音演說法，眾生隨類各得解，	The Buddha preaches the Law with a single voice, but each living being understands it according to his kind.
皆謂世尊同其語，斯則神力不共法；	All believe the World-Honored One speaks the same words to all— such are his transcendental powers, his unshared properties.
佛以一音演說法，眾生各各隨所解，	The Buddha preaches the Law with a single voice,but each living being understands it in his own way.
普得受行獲其利，斯則神力不共法；	All undertake the Buddha's practices and gain profit thereby— such are his transcendental powers, his unshared properties.
佛以一音演說法，或有恐畏或歡喜，	The Buddha preaches the Law with a single voice, but to some it brings fear, to others delight and joy.
或生厭離或斷疑，斯則神力不共法。	Some are moved to leave the world, some are freed of doubt— such are his transcendental powers, his unshared properties.
稽首十力大精進，稽首已得無所畏，	Before the great diligence of the ten-powered one we bow our heads; we bow our heads to the fearlessness he has attained.
稽首住於不共法，稽首一切大導師，	We bow heads before the one who dwells in unshared properties, bow heads before the great leader of all beings.
稽首能斷眾結縛，稽首已到於彼岸，	You can cut the thongs that bind the multitude—we bow heads to that; you crossed to the other shore—we bow heads to that.
稽首能度諸世間，稽首永離生死道。	We bow heads to one who can save all those in this world, bow heads to one who long ago left the path of birth and death.
悉知眾生來去相，善於諸法得解脫，	You know the marks of all beings in their comings and goings, you have gained apt liberation from all phenomena.
不著世間如蓮華，常善入於空寂行，達諸法相無罣礙，稽首如空無所依。	Free of worldly attachments, like the lotus blossom,constantly you move within the realm of emptiness and quiet; you have mastered the marks of all phenomena, no blocks or hindrances; like the sky, you lean on nothing— we bow our heads!
爾時長者子寶積說此偈已，白佛言：	When the rich man's son, Jeweled Accumulation, had finished reciting these verses, he addressed the Buddha, saying, 
「世尊！是五百長者子，皆已發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，	World-Honored One, these five hundred sons of rich men have all set their minds on anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. 
願聞得佛國土清淨，	They wish to hear how one can purify the Buddha lands.
唯願世尊說諸菩薩淨土之行！」	We beg the World-Honored One to explain the practices carried out by bodhisattvas in purifying the lands.
佛言：	The Buddha said, 
「善哉！寶積！	Excellent, Jeweled Accumulation! 
乃能為諸菩薩，問於如來淨土之行。	For the sake of the bodhisattvas you do right to ask the Thus Come One about the practices for purifying the lands.
諦聽，諦聽！	Listen well, listen well,
善思念之，當為汝說！」	and mull it over in your thoughts! I will now explain to you.
於是寶積及五百長者子受教而聽。	Jeweled Accumulation and the other five hundred sons of rich men then made ready to listen to the teachings addressed to them.
佛言：「寶積！眾生之類是菩薩佛土。	The Buddha said, Jeweled Accumulation, the various kinds of living beings are in themselves the Buddha lands of the bodhisattvas.
所以者何？菩薩隨所化眾生而取佛土，	Why so? Because it is by converting various beings to the teachings that the bodhisattvas acquire their Buddha lands.
隨所調伏眾生而取佛土，	It is by persuading various beings and overcoming their objections that the bodhisattvas acquire their Buddha lands.
隨諸眾生應以何國入佛智慧而取佛土，	It is by inducing the various living beings to enter into the Buddha wisdom in such-and-such a land that they acquire their Buddha lands.
隨諸眾生應以何國起菩薩根而取佛土。	It is by inducing the various living beings to develop the capacity for bodhisattva practices in such-and-such a land that they acquire their Buddha lands.
所以者何？	Why is this?
菩薩取於淨國，皆為饒益諸眾生故。	Because the bodhisattva's acquisition of a pure land is wholly due to his having brought benefit to living beings.
譬如有人，欲於空地造立宮室，	Suppose a man proposes to build a mansion on a plot of open land.
隨意無礙；	He may do so as he wishes without hindrance.
若於虛空，終不能成！	But if he tries to build it in the empty air, he will never be successful.
菩薩如是，	It is the same with the bodhisattvas.
為成就眾生故，願取佛國，	It is because they wish to help others to achieve success that they take their vow to acquire Buddha lands.
願取佛國者，非於空也。	Their vow to acquire Buddha lands is not founded on emptiness.
寶積！當知：直心是菩薩淨土	Jeweled Accumulation, you should understand that an upright mind is the pure land of the bodhisattva.

「如是，寶積！菩薩隨其直心，則能發行；	Therefore, Jeweled Accumulation, because the bodhisattva has an upright mind, he is impelled to action.
隨其發行，則得深心；	Because he is impelled to action, he gains a deeply searching mind.
隨其深心，則意調伏；	Because he has a deeply searching mind, his will is well controlled.
隨意調伏，則如說行；	Because his will is well controlled, he acts in accord with the teachings.
隨如說行，則能迴向；	Because he acts in accord with the teachings, he can transfer merit to others.
隨其迴向，則有方便；	Because he transfers merit to others, he knows how to employ expedient means.

隨成就眾生，則佛土淨；	Because he leads others to enlightenment, his Buddha land is pure.
隨佛土淨，則說法淨；	Because his Buddha land is pure, his preaching of the Law is pure.
隨說法淨，則智慧淨；	Because his preaching of the Law is pure, his wisdom is pure.
隨其心淨，則一切功德淨。	And because his mind is pure, all the blessings he enjoys will be pure.
是故，寶積！若菩薩欲得淨土，當淨其心；	Therefore, Jeweled Accumulation, if the bodhisattva wishes to acquire a pure land, he must purify his mind.
隨其心淨，則佛土淨。」	When the mind is pure, the Buddha land will be pure.
爾時舍利弗承佛威神作是念：	At that time Śāriputra, moved by the Buddha's supernatural powers, thought to himself: 
「若菩薩心淨，則佛土淨者，	If the mind of the bodhisattva is pure, then his Buddha land will be pure.
我世尊本為菩薩時，意豈不淨，	Now when our World-Honored One first determined to become a bodhisattva, surely his intentions were pure.
而是佛土不淨若此？」	Why then is this Buddha land so filled with impurities?
佛知其念，即告之言：	The Buddha, knowing his thoughts, said to him, 
「於意云何？	What do you think? 
日月豈不淨耶，	Are the sun and moon impure? 
而盲者不見？」	Is that why the blind man fails to see them
「於意云何？	What do you think? 
對曰：「不也，世尊！	Śāriputra replied, No, World-Honored One.
是盲者過，	That is the fault of the blind man. 
非日月咎。」	The sun and moon are not to blame.
「舍利弗！眾生罪故，不見如來佛土嚴淨，	Śāriputra, it is the failings of living beings that prevent them from seeing the marvelous purity of the land of the Buddha, the Thus Come One.
非如來咎；	The Thus Come One is not to blame.
舍利弗！我此土淨，而汝不見。」	Śāriputra, this land of mine is pure, but you fail to see it.
爾時螺髻梵王語舍利弗：	At that time one of the Brahma kings with his conch-shaped tuft of hair said to Śāriputra,
「勿作是意，謂此佛土以為不淨。	You must not think that this Buddha land is impure.
所以者何？	Why do I say this? 
我見釋迦牟尼佛土清淨，譬如自在天宮。」	Because to my eyes, Shakyamuni's Buddha land is as pure and spotless as the palace of the heavenly being Great Freedom.
舍利弗言：	Śāriputra said, 
「我見此土丘陵坑坎、荊蕀沙礫、土石諸山、穢惡充滿。」	When I look at this land, I see it full of knolls and hollows, thorny underbrush, sand and gravel, dirt, rocks, many mountains, filth and defilement.
螺髻梵王言：	The Brahma king said,
「仁者心有高下，不依佛慧，故見此土為不淨耳！	It is just that your mind has highs and lows and does not rest on Buddha wisdom. Therefore you see this land as impure.
舍利弗！菩薩於一切眾生悉皆平等，	Śāriputra, the bodhisattva treats all things and beings, each one of them, with perfect equality.
深心清淨，依佛智慧，則能見此佛土清淨。」	His deeply searching mind is pure, and because it rests on Buddha wisdom, it can see the purity of this Buddha land.
於是佛以足指按地，即時三千大千世界，若干百千珍寶嚴飾，譬如寶莊嚴佛無量功德寶莊嚴土，	The Buddha then pressed his toe against the earth, and immediately the thousand-millionfold world was adorned with hundreds and thousands of rare jewels, till it resembled Jeweled Adornment Buddha's Jeweled Adornment Land of Immeasurable Blessings.
一切大眾歎未曾有，而皆自見坐寶蓮華。	All the members of the great assembly sighed in wonder at what they had never seen before, and all saw that they themselves were seated on jeweled lotuses.
佛告舍利弗：「汝且觀是佛土嚴淨？」	The Buddha said to Śāriputra, Now do you see the marvellous purity of this Buddha land?
舍利弗言：「唯然，世尊！	Śāriputra replied, Indeed I do, World-Honored One.
本所不見，本所不聞，今佛國土嚴淨悉現。」	Something I have never seen before, and never even heard of— now all the marvelous purity of the Buddha land is visible before me!
佛語舍利弗：	The Buddha said to Śāriputra, 
「我佛國土常淨若此，	My Buddha land has always been pure like this.
為欲度斯下劣人故，示是眾惡不淨土耳！	But because I wish to save those persons who are lowly and inferior, I make it seem an impure land full of defilements, that is all.
譬如諸天，共寶器食，隨其福德，飯色有異。	It is like the case of heavenly beings. All take their food from the same precious vessel, but the food looks different for each one, depending upon the merits and virtues that each possesses.
如是，舍利弗！若人心淨，便見此土功德莊嚴。」	It is the same in this case, Śāriputra. If a person's mind is pure, then he will see the wonderful blessings that adorn this land.
當佛現此國土嚴淨之時，寶積所將五百長者子皆得無生法忍，八萬四千人皆發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心。	When the Buddha in this way revealed the marvelous purity of the land, the five hundred sons of rich men who accompanied Jeweled Accumulation all were able to grasp the truth of birthlessness, and eighty-four thousand persons all set their minds on attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.
佛攝神足，於是世界還復如故；	The Buddha then released the supernatural power that he had exercised with his toe and the world returned to its former appearance.
求聲聞乘三萬二千天及人，知有為法皆悉無常，遠塵離垢，得法眼淨；八千比丘，不受諸法，漏盡意解。	Thirty-two thousand heavenly and human beings who wished to pursue the path of the voice-hearer, understanding that all things are impermanent in nature, cast off the dust, removed themselves from defilement, and attained the pure Dharma eye; and eight thousand monks, ceasing to accept the phenomenal world, put an end to all outflows and gained emancipation of mind.
