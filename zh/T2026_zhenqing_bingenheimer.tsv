天台慈雲寺沙門釋真清傳(寶珠 荊山 月溪)	Biography of the monk Shi Zhenqing of the Tiantai Ciyun Monastery (With remarks on Baozhu, Jingshan, and Yuexi) 
釋真清，號象先，長沙湘潭羅氏子也。	Shi Zhenqing, aka Xiangxian, was of the Luo clan from Xiangtan near Changsha [in Hunan].
生而穎異，脩幹玉立，威儀嚴肅，不妄言笑。日誦經史數千言，終身不忘一字。	He was intelligent from birth, and grew to be tall and handsome. He was serious in his demeanor, did not speak or laugh without reason. Every day he read out several thousand words from the classics and histories, and throughout his life never forgot a single character.
父為河南縣尹，常對賓朋以大器期之。	His father became the Magistrate of a county in Henan, where he often spoke of his great expectations for him in front of guests and visitors.
年十五，補邑弟子員。偶有異僧過，而目之曰：「此,法門之良驥也。」	When he was fifteen, his name was added among the town’s licentiates. Once, an unusual monk passed by and characterized Zhenqing saying: “This is a champion for the Dharma.”
十九因家難起，遂投南嶽伏虎巖，依寶珠和尚薙染、受具足戒。	When he was nineteen, the family fell on hard times, and he went to the Fuhu Cliff on Nanyue, the Southern Marchmount, [in Hunan, where his father was from], where he took tonsure with Master Baozhu and [soon after] was fully ordained. 
令看「無字」話，自是一心參究，寒暑不輟。	After he was ordered to contemplate the [gong’an] phrase regarding the character wu, he concentrated on it fully and constantly, winter and summer.
至二十五從珠遊金陵、探禹穴。因舟觸岸有聲，忽有省。珠大喜曰：「幸子大事已明，善宜保護。」	When he was twenty-five, he traveled with Baozhu to Nanjing, then visited the Tomb of Yu the Great. [During the journey,] the sound of the boat touching on the shore caused a sudden insight. Baozhu said with great delight: “Congratulations, you have now understood the Great Matter. Maintain and protect [this understanding] well.”
珠以年高，自普陀棲隱於下天竺。時內臣張公永慕珠道行，密奏張太后，賜紫色僧伽黎衣以徵其德。	Baozhu, already advanced in age, then went from Mount Putuo to retire at Lower Tianzhu Monastery [in Hangzhou]. One time [many years earlier], the eunuch Master Zhang Yong had admired Baozhu’s practice, and petitioned the Empress Dowager Zhang (d. ) in secret to bestow the purple robe on him as a testimony to his virtue.
珠忽一日命清曰：「吾欲觀化。無令人入。聞吾擊磬聲，當啟戶。」	One day, Baozhu suddenly ordered Zhenqing: “I shall enter my death meditation now. Do not allow anyone in. Only open the door when I strike the gong.”
數日不聞動定，師密窺牖隙，見珠鼻柱垂地。越一日，聞磬，師方排闥而入，珠已泯然逝矣！	After several days had passed without a sound, Zhenqing peered in through the gaps of the window shutter and saw Baozhu’s head bent towards the floor. The next day Zhenqing heard the gong, and only then opened the door to the retreat and entered. Baozhu was already dead.
珠既化去，師乃訪鹽官古蹟，駐錫覺皇。俄患背疾。感雲長入夢，授藥病愈。	After Baozhu had died, Zhenqing visited the old town of Yanguan, and took up residence in the Juehuang Monastery. One time, his back suddenly started to hurt. This moved Guan Yu to appear to him in a dream and give him a medicine, which healed his illness.
時佛慧寺月溪法師講《起信論》於吉祥，豔師乃率眾延唱臨濟宗旨，眾扣師室。師從容語之曰：	One time, the Dharma Master Yuexi of the Fohui Temple [in Hangzhou] lectured on the “Treatise on the Awakening of Faith” at the Jixiang Monastery. Out of admiration for Zhenqing he led his congregation to learn from him about the core teaching of the Linji School. When they came to his door, Zhenqing calmly said: 
「圓宗無象，滿教難思。我若有宗可講，非但法堂前草深一丈，即真空亦為緣慮之場；	“The perfect transmission is without sign, the full teaching difficult to discern. If I had a core transmission to lecture on, not only would the front yard of my Dharma Hall be overgrown with tall grasses, but even true emptiness would become a site for ordinary thought.
汝若有法可聽，豈特頭上安頭，實際却為聲名之境？	And if there was a Dharma you could listen to, would it not be like putting another head on your head? And the ultimate, wouldn’t it be the realm of sounds and concepts?
三世諸佛、歷代祖師，不過以楔出楔，隨迷遣迷。是故會旨者山嶽易移，乖宗者錙銖難入。	The Buddhas of past, present and future, the line of patriarchs throughout history, have simply used wedges to remove wedges, following delusions in order to dispatch them. One who knows the principle can easily move mountains, one who deviates from it can’t even begin to understand it.
况《起信》之旨大徹宗乘，何須更煩 忉怛勉之？」眾皆稽首而退。	How much less does the meaning of the ‘Treatise on the Awakening of Faith,’ which pervades our tradition, need belabored explanations!” The group bowed, paid their respects and left.	
師乃南遊天台，窮搜勝絕。	Later, Zhenqing went south to visit the Tiantai Mountains and their famous sites. 
懷無見覩之高風，誅茆其塔前三年。	Longing for Wujian [Xian]du’s lofty presence, he built a hut and lived next to [Xiandu’s] stūpa for three years.
有荊山法師赴石梁之社，偕師至毘陵永慶，互以《楞嚴》參究。	[After that,] Ven. Jingshan [Yuanke], came to Shiliang, and together they went to the Yongqing Monastery in Piling, to study the Lengyan Sūtra.
荊山歎曰：「某所講經，雖精微于佛語，聞師所論，誠出卷于塵中。」	Jingshan sighed and said: “When I discuss the scriptures, I can expound the words of the Buddha with great subtlety, but only on hearing your explanations, are the texts truly lifted out of the ordinary.”
師欲返初服，而禮部唐公荊川留結千日之期。	Zhenqing wanted to return to his former life, but Master Tang Jingchuan from the Ministry of Rites detained him at Jingzhou for days.
已而，復歸天台古平田寺。臨海王司寇敬所入山訪道，訂為方外交。	After that he returned to the old Pingtian Monastery at Tiantai. The Minister of Justice Wang Jingsuo of Linhai went into the mountains to ask for the Way, and they became friends.
隨遷華頂天柱峰，修大、小彌陀懺六年。	Later, Zhenqing moved to Tianzhu Peak in the Huading range [of the Tiantai region], where he performed the longer and shorter Amitābha repentance ritual for six years.
暇則敷演十乘，闡明三觀，故四方學者攀蘿而至者，戶外之履常滿。	Whenever he was free, he would explain the ten modes of contemplation and the three observations. Thus, learned men from everywhere would make the climb [up Tianzhu Peak]–his anteroom was always filled with the shoes [of visitors].
一夕夢琳宮綺麗，寶樹參差，見彌陀三聖。	One night he dreamed of a marvelous palace, surrounded by thickets of precious, bejeweled trees. There, he saw the Amitābha Triad.
師方展拜，傍有沙彌，授與一牌，書曰：「戒香薰修。」	As he was going to prostrate himself, a novice appeared at his side and handed him a plaque. The inscription said: “Steeped in the Scent of Precepts”.
寤，知中品往生之象也。	When he awakened, he understood this to be a sign that he had attained the fifth rank of rebirth in the Pure Land [out of nine].
蓋師日勤五悔，密持《梵網心地品》及《十六觀經》為常課，是亦精誠之所感耳！	This is because Zhenqing diligently practiced the penance the five elements of repentance every day, and ‘in secret’ recited the Fanwang jing and the Shiliu guan jing daily. Thus, is the effect of the seriousness of his practice.
嘗示眾曰：「大乘八萬，小乘三千，實整六和之模範，出三界之梯航也。	He once said to his audience: “The 80,000 practices of the Mahāyāna, the 3,000 regulations of the Hīnayāna, are all in fact guides and examples for the six harmonies [of correct behavior in the Vinaya]; they are a ladder, a ferry to leave the three realms.
今世之高流，輕蔑律儀，惟恃見解，遂令後學不遵佛制，輒犯規繩。	The elites of today make light of the precepts and solely depend on understanding by insight. This results in their students not respecting what the Buddha instituted [in the Vinaya] and thus deviating from the norm.
本自無愆，誤造深罪，饒他才過七步，辯若懸河，不免識墮鐵城，終未解脫。	Although this is not the fault of these [students], their misunderstanding causes them to commit grave sins. Even if they are able to preach brilliantly extempore, their arguments mellifluous like a river, they will still go to hell, and in the end fail to attain liberation.
汝等勉之！」	Please make a strong effort.”
萬歷丁亥八月，蒙慈聖宣文明肅皇太后遣使降旨褒崇賜金紋紫方袍以寵之。	In the eighth lunar month of 1587, the Empress Dowager Cisheng, graciously sent a messenger and favored Zhenqing with a gold-embroidered purple robe.
十月，王太初居士因丁內艱，請師就永明禪室闡《妙宗鈔》，百日為期。	In the tenth month the mother of the layman Wang Taichu died, and he entreated Zhengqing to teach the Miaozong chao at the Yongming Chan Room for a hundred days.
時台郡王理邢某，親登雲嶠而設供焉。	At one time the Judicial Bureau official of Tai County, a certain Mr. Wang, himself climbed up the cloudy peaks [of Tiantai] and brought offerings.
戊子歲儉，群盜蜂起，相戒無敢入師之室。	In the year 1588 there was a crop failure, and the region swarmed with bandits. But they agreed among themselves that they would not dare to enter the master’s room.
𭬥李五臺居士陸光祖虛芙蓉之席見招，辭不赴。	The “Wutai Layman” Lu Guangzu of Zuili once invited Zhenqing, preparing a Dharma Seat, but he declined the invitation.
忽謂眾曰：	One day, Zhenqing abruptly told his followers:
「桃源之慈雲，實懶融四世孫為開山，唐天寶賜額曰雲居山、曰安國。	“The Ciyun Monastery at Taoyuan, was actually founded by a fourth generation student of [Niutou Fa]rong. In the Tianbao reign of the Tang it was bestowed an plaque naming it ‘Yunju Shan 雲居山,’ and another plaque naming it ‘Anguo 安國’ [Monastery]. 
五代德韶國師中興，為第二道場，永明壽禪師鬀髮之所。	During the Five Dynasties, the National Preceptor Deshao restored it. It was the second monastery he rebuilt [out of many at Tiantai]. This is where Yongming [Yan]shou took tonsure. 
今坐禪石，永明庵故址在焉！	Today, there still are the ruins of Yongming’s hermitage at the ‘Stone of Sitting in Chan.’ 
韶公常領徒五百，說法此地。	Here, Deshao often led the assembly of his students, to teach them Dharma.
昔螺溪寂法師請復台教，諦觀亦親禮足，皆此寺也。今為豪民奪之，將為掩骨之所。	At this monastery, too, Dharma Master Luoxi [Xi]ji once revived the Tiantai teachings, and [the Korean monk] Chegwan became his disciple here. Today, some powerful local families have seized control of the land, and use it to bury their dead. 
竊思，朝廷千數百年之香火，一旦為俗子葬地，誰之罪也？」	I do ask myself, whose fault is it [but our own], that the site where the imperial incense fires burned for more than  years, has now become a graveyard for commoners?”
遂罄衣鉢，贖歸之，將謀興建。	He then went about to sell his bowl and clothes in order to buy the site back, because he was planning to rebuild the monastery.
俄雲間 陸宗伯平泉 聘說法于本一院。李方伯沖涵聘講於桐川。	[However,] just then [he was called away from Tiantai, when] first the Director of the Court of the Imperial Clan, Lu Pingquan of Yunjian, invited him to teach at the Benyi [Chan]yuan [near Shanghai], and then the Provincial Administration Commissioner Li Chonghan invited him to lecture at Tongchuan [in Anhui].
再畢返棹嘉禾龍淵，歘抱疾，告門人曰：	Once done there, he went back via boat to the Longyuan Monastery in Jiahe, where he fell sick. He told his followers: 
「夜來神人啟我為魏府子，其富貴非吾所志也。」	“At night in a dream a spirit came to me and revealed that I would be reborn as a son in a wealthy family with the surname Wei, but such fortune I do not desire.”
遂付衣鉢，遺囑弟子如法闍維，盡發長物於五臺雲棲、西興，五處飯僧。	He then passed on his robe and bowl [to me, Ruxing,] and asked his disciples to cremate him according to the rules. All his other things were to be taken, some to the Yunqi Monastery on Mount Wutai, the Xixing village [near Hangzhou, etc., in all] five places, to pay for the upkeep of monks there.
有勉服藥石者，師謝曰：「生死藥能拒乎？吾 淨土 緣 熟，聖境冥現。	Some urged him to take medicine, but he refused, saying: “What medicine is there against birth and death? My time to enter the Pure Land has come; the realm of the holy ones is appearing at the border of life and death.
此人間世固不久矣！」	Surely, this human life is almost done.”
是歲正月七日乃絕粒，惟飲檀香水而已。期於二十九日告終。	After the th day of the first lunar month of that year he stopped eating grains and drank only some water perfumed with sandalwood incense. He announced his death for the 29th day.
每日雖米漿不入於口，與眾說無生法，誨諭進修而拳拳弗倦。	During that period, although not even eating rice gruel, he expounded the Dharma of non-arising every day, and exhorted the assembly to keep practicing tirelessly.
至夕乃起別眾曰：「吾即逝矣，無以世俗事累我。」	When his last evening came, he took his leave from the assembly, saying “I am going to leave now. Do not bother me with mundane matters anymore.”
眾請曰：「和尚往生淨土。九品奚居？」曰：「中品中生也。」	[Someone in] the assembly asked: “Going from here, which of the nine ranks will you assume when reborn in the Pure Land?” He said: “The second of the middle rank [i.e., rank five].”
眾曰：「胡不上品生耶？」曰：「吾戒香所薰位止中品。」	The assembly: “Why won't you be reborn in the upper ranks?” He said: “The ‘perfume of my precepts’ reaches only the middle rank.”
言畢泊然而逝，	With these words, he passed away quietly.
延五日顏色紅潤如生，手足溫軟，怡容可掬，吊者無敢下拜。	Five days later his cheeks were still rosy as if alive, his hands and feet warm and soft. His countenance was happy and so lifelike that the mourners hardly dared to bow down [as part of the funeral rites].
荼毗日 天色霽明，淨無纖翳，舉火之際，忽有片雲，如蓋凝覆其上，灑微雨數點。	On the day of his cremation, the weather had cleared up, and not a cloud was in the sky. But the moment the fire was lighted, a little cloud appeared suddenly. It grew denser just above the cremation site, like a canopy, and gently sprinkled a few drops of rain.
烟焰起時，異香充塞，內自殿閣僧房，外自路人船子，所聞種種，隨力不同。	When the fire arose, an extraordinary scent filled the air, and everybody, those in the monastery halls and monks’ quarters, as well as those outside, the people on the roads and in their boats, all smelled something different, according to their powers [of insight].
火餘骨有三色，而鏘鏘有聲。	The bones remaining in the ashes were of three colors and made a clear sound [when tapped].
紅者如桃，白者如玉，綠者潤似琅竿，猶香氣郁郁。	The red ones were red like peach blossoms, the white ones like white jade, the green was lustrous like green jade, all had a pleasant scent.
師生於嘉靖丁酉十二月二十六日。	Zhenqing was born on the th day of the twelfth lunar month in the Jiajing year with the cyclical signs dingyou.
清寂於萬曆癸巳正月二十九日，世壽五十七，臘三十八。	Zhenqing died on the th day of the first lunar month in the Wanli year with the cyclical signs guisi. He was 57 years old, and had been a monk for 38 years.
如惺抱骨，初建塔慈雲之南岡。壬寅遷于寺西螺師山右，繡文溪之上。	Ruxing collected his bones and first built a stūpa [for them] at the southern slope of Ciyun Monastery. In 1602, it was moved to right side of Mount Luoshi west of the monastery, on the banks of the Xiuwen River.
武塘了凡居士袁黃撰銘。	Yuan Huang, the lay-follower Liaofan from Wutang, wrote an inscription.
